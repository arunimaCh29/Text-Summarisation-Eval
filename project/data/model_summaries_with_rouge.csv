So basically me and my gf at the time were having sex pretty regularly so everything was becoming pretty normal when it comes to sex. So one night when I put my dick in her I pull out because I thought at the time I put it in wrong or some shit idk. So when I pull out I hear a noise that sounded like a fart. I look at her and I said what the fuck was that and she basically said that was my vagina's reaction to your dick. Either she is a lesbian or my dick tastes bad or just quiefed.

"Not Really an Answer to your question, but a great boner story.
During high school i used to wear tight jeans, so my boners where pretty visible. One day i was with my girlfriend next to her class during passing period(Her class was near the front of the school). She had been teasing me all day and i had a massive boner. Suddenly the bell rings, i have to run all the way to the back of the school because that's where my class is. I look down, and its looking back at me. I say ''fuck it'', and run like fuck to my class. About halfway there i realize my dick is feeling pretty good. My tight jeans were pulling my junk back and forth as i ran to class. I bullshit you not , by the time i sat down i had already jizzed. There was this massive wet/sticky spot on my jeans.

 lol @ you thinking you know your shit. 
 The M16 and Famas have a firerate of 460. The Intervention has a fire rate of 65. 
 450 bullets via a 3 round burst per min vs. 65 single shot bullets per min = burst fire guns having a higher fire rate. 
 The Famas and M16 have a TTK of almost 0, meaning it kills just as as fast as any Sniper rifle/Shotgun. 
 Not only that the fire time in between bursts for the M16 and Famas is .065 seconds vs. the Intervention's .925. Basically it just adds more proof that the M16 and Famas are just fucking better than any Sniper Rifle. 
 >I'd like to see some statistics on this. Drastic statistics actually.

"So today in PE class we were playing basketball, and most of the girls were playing volleyball but a couple were playing basketball with me and some other guys. So the girls kept on saying ""don't touch me"" so they usually got free shots and most of the guys kinda just didn't really care. I'm a rather competitive player even if the game is just for fun, so one of the girls kept saying ""don't touch me"" and just traveled the ball to right next to the hoop, she shot the ball.

"Well it doesn't sound like you are the ""bad"" kind of real estate broker. There is a lot more at stake when investment/sales is involved so it makes sense to have somebody who knows the market well. 
 otoh, 99% of the time a broker for rentals is a useless parasite that only exists due to landlords greed and laziness.

Ah but that would require getting off your ass and doing some actual work (albeit a minimal amount) as opposed to just collecting a check.

"Basically, I like to watch a guy and a girl fuck (including average foreplay of oral/hand exchanges) and be enthusiastic about it.

"Political correctness"" is another term for being overly polite and sensitive.

"Pretty fucking stupid if you ask me.  Everyone's talking about the NDA, when that's not the problem.  If I signed an NDA with Chevron, it wouldn't mean shit until they actually started telling me confidential information.  The NDA with Riot Games doesn't tell us anything, but if Riot is giving confidential information to the moderators of /r/leagueoflegends because they're moderators, that clearly violates the policy on Reddit that states ""You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties"".

"IMO, unions of today are quite unlike the unions that built the United States equal wages.  Now it seems like they are just pawns for multinational corporate glut. Negotiate the highest wages for the least amount of actual ""work."" 
     For example the teachers on strike right now in Chicago (who are ignoring the needs of their students) are demanding a wage increase of no less than 25% plus pension and benefits for their work.  Meanwhile the average graduation rate in high schools in these Chicago districts is less than 60%. Not to mention that the average reading comprehension scores of these districts are lagging by 2 full grades or more.

That led to calling the paramedics because it turned out not to be what it was advertised to be, which led to us spending a day in jail and now fighting drug charges, and she may not be able to graduate college because of that. That led to rougher times in the relationship and now we're technically on a break but still living together at the moment and things are in a very strange place.

"Stop giving these guys so much flak.  I'm not saying the Black Eyed Peas are always great live performers (I've never seen them live before), but I can absolutely guarantee you the mix was to blame on this one.

"I went on a hiking trip with a group leader. We ate a shit ton of food before we left for the hike (this was around 6 am). I immediately felt a little grumble in my stomach and I ignored it, obviously: didn't want to hold back the group, so I continued on. We walked for about 30 minutes and we entered some rural areas where there was a road. I started feeling the shit collecting on the bottom of my anus while my buthole clenched furiously.

"How the hell can you possibly fuck up by drinking coffee"" 
Aight, so I brewed up a really nice hot cup of coffee early in the morning, and decided to go outside our house and relax. 
 What happened next was that I left my mug outside just for like 10 seconds since I wanted to get something from inside the house. When I came back and drank my coffee, that was the worst thing I've ever done in my entire life. 
 Apparently, my artsy little sister was collecting pretty rocks that time, and I know that whenever she goes out, she'd pretty much keep a cup of muddy water (which I have to assume was full rocks that she was trying to clean). Now the bad thing about this is that  the cup had the same design as my cup of coffee . 
 Mixed with all the mud from the rocks, the water turned brown. Which looked  exactly  like my coffee. 
 So she accidentally mixed up my cup of coffee and her cup of mud,  and  I drank a cup of mud, and she placed rocks in my coffee .

"About six years ago while walking home from work, I heard a loud screeching and a large BANG, that could only have come from a car crash. I ran to where it came from, and saw that an SUV had t-boned a small hatchback. The crash was big, but not  huge , but the hatchback was quite old and pretty busted up. 
 Being a first-aider, I ran over to see if I could help anyone, expecting nothing more than whip-lash, sprained limbs and shock. 
 Nope!

"My Mum (52F) and I (25F) had a massive argument this morning. I asked if she could tie my dress at the back and you could see my bra. I asked her if she could cover my bra, and I may have said it in an annoyed voice due to many factors, including tiredness. She snapped at me and called me demanding, Hitler, bossy etc. I asked her to stop it and she kept going. I then lost it and screamed at her to stop it. I then burst into tears. 
 This made it worse. She went on a tangent, saying I over react, why the hell am I crying. My Dad got angry at her and said to stop it as well.

"Think like a lurid, evil bastard: 
 
 Have several of your tough guys slaughter your enemy's bodyguards in front of him, possibly in public if you are of high enough stature to get away with it or you can catch them cutting through a slum on their way somewhere. 
 
 Once the bodyguards are out of the way, have the toughs force the fellow to his knees and put a knife to his throat. Maybe cut a little to whip him up into a frenzy of terror. 
 
 Then have the toughs force his jaws open and insert wedges made of wood. Danger averted. 
 
 If you went with the ""in public"" option and you're rich enough, have gold wedges made instead of wood. Flash them about prominently like a stage magician before shoving them into the guy's mouth. People will talk about that shit for generations. 
 
 Now you can violate your enemy's mouth and humiliate him like no one else ever has been.

"This isn't fucked up.  It's just a pretty big secret about my cousin.  All names are changed. 
 One day my friend Corey (who happens to be gay) asked me about my cousin Michael and how I knew him.  Corey noticed that we were all mutual friends on facebook which probably seemed unlikely to him because Michael lives on the other side of the state as Corey and I.  I told Corey that he was actually my cousin and Corey proceeded to tell me that they had been fuck buddies for awhile.  They had apparently met online, started texting, and then meeting up occasionally and having sex.  Keep in mind that Michael comes off as very straight to everyone that knows him.  He's a hunter and he played football in high school. It was quite surprising to me. I didn't really believe Corey until he showed me the naked pics that Michael sent him, which were unmistakable.  It makes me kind of sad that I'm the only person in my entire family that knows Michael is gay. He must be very deep in the closet but I really hope that one day he can truly show who he is to the world.",1065,"Gay friend told me he had been butt fucking my supposedly straight cousin and no one else in the world knows.

"I met my wife on WoW. 
 I used to be on a PVP realm, but I was sick of it, so i chose a random PVE realm and transferred there. Got into a guild immediately, met some cool people (One of which was her).

 She found a friend in me, we would talk late into the night. Eventually I convinced her to stand up to his bullshit and tell him its the game or her, He chose the game (Fucking douche).

"Almost... Camping with friends.  Sitting around a fire, our food on a picnic table about 20 yards behind us.  Suddenly I hear a plastic rustling sounds coming from the table.  The only thing I KNEW was in a plastic bag was the cinnamon bread we were saving from breakfast the next morning.  I got up (drunk) walked over to the picnic table to investigate only to see the notorious bandit of the wild.  A raccoon.  He hadn't opened the bag he was just gripping onto it. 
So I yelled at him, he looked up at me and gave me a look like ""Fuck you! dis mine."" He grabbed the bag in his mouth and took off into the night.  I (being drunk) decided I could out run this thieving little shit, so I followed suit.
After a some what lengthy pursuit I had gained on him to the point where he realized he wouldn't out run me.  He stopped and turned toward me and gently set the bag down and backed off with a look of ""Hey man, its cool, my bad dude.""  He then ran off into the darkness.

"That's from Rumble in The Bronx. Like 500* bones were broken making that movie. Jackie also fights a hovercraft in it. Let me reiterate that: 
 In Rumble In The Bronx Jackie Chan fights a hovercraft...and WINS 
 Jackie Chan is such a bad-ass that the bad guys get so tired of getting kicked up and down the street, they give up halfway through and make friends with Jackie to start a new life. Not only is Jackie Chan a badass, he's fucking Doctor Phil. 
 They still had a whole half a movie left, so they have to bring in  ultra bad guys  with machine guns. Obviously this isn't sufficient. You can't beat Jackie Chan with mere man power. You have to move to fucking heavy machinery. 
 Even then he will jump on your hovercraft, and if you knock him off he will just steal a fucking Lamborghini and a pole and fucking joust your hovercraft. Then he will patch up your hovercraft and use it to go after your boss.

"One time I ate a metric fuck load (14 scoops) of ice cream as a celebration for it being my last night in a foreign country. I felt great, then okay, then queasy, then...shitttt. I asked the only person in my group who spoke the native language to ask the waitress where the bathroom was. She motioned towards a back door. I staggered through it and into a courtyard behind the ice cream shop. I frantically looked around for anything indicating a restroom and saw only one door. At this point I could feel the ice cream doing a 180 and starting to begin its ascent. I ran through the door and found anotherdoor with a latch. I blindly fumbled the door open and, thank baby Jesus, there was a toilet. Close enough. Like a high pressured faucet my jaw unhinged and a jet of ice-vomit came cascading out. All. Over. The stall.

 Drinking is fine but regularly getting blackout drunk is not; even though it's one of those things that current culture tells everyone is ""cool"". Just a few decades ago drunks were looked down upon as suckers and encouraged to stop before making fools of themselves. 
 Drinking fuels unnecessary street violence. Drunk drivers kill innocent people. People get addicted and sick, and in the slim chance they quit in time without physical damage they'll be tortured the rest of their life having to avoid even sensible drinking. Don't get me started on people who drink to 'dull their feelings' (ie: boo-hoo, everyone). 
 If you're a drunk, you're likely a dickhead set on a path to ruin your own life and the lives of people around you. 
 Anyhow it seems you've noticed that getting drunk is an expensive hobby that fixes nothing and makes you feel bad.

"So this girl I had seen once the previous weekend asked if she could come over. I said ok, we ended up drinking some, then went out to dance. We got very drunk, and slept together when we came home. 
 We did all sorts of crazy stuff and then we came to a mutual understanding - to have anal sex. I had always thought of it as a bit forbidden and exciting, and was feeling nervous for it. We went slow at first, and it felt good(not as good as I thought though), and then harder after a while. She said it felt good, so we kept going. 
 However, when I pulled out, the shit hit the fan. Weird suction in her arse made the contents fly out and cover my sheets and some of my walls. I was panicking, picking up the pieces and threw them in the toilet. When I came back in, she had started bleeding as well. I asked her if we need to go to the hospital. She was all quiet, said it was ok, and then just left. I was standing naked in my room, smelly condom on my dick, blood and shit on my sheets. 
 Now, 12 hours later, I've thrown away the sheets, cleaned my walls but my room smells really bad. And I never wanna do anal again.",1125,"Had anal sex - had to clean up girl's shit, room smells like it, anal sex ruined.

 Secondly, idiots. Fucking idiots. Much like the Rim Fire going on now, the Crystal Canyon fire here in Northern Colorado began because some idiot lit a slash pile on fire with cans (plural) of gasoline, then left the scene.

"Boot the game, kick ass with abilities (Auto attack excluded), and do some pretty neat sidequests as an explorer.  I just started the 10-day trial of Wildstar and it just FEELS good. 
 This game is actually really sick.  I'm in a Dominion base claiming vengeance and my guns were like ""wrrrrrr, POW!"" and the enemies were like ""Screw you!  Stop rolling and blinking all over the place!"" and I was like ""Why should I!?  And look, your turrets are getting blown up!""

"I tell you  exactly  why that shit remains the same. 
 Although the laws against venting refrigerant were enacted in the 90's, there's  plenty  of unscrupulous companies that still dump refrigerant straight into the atmosphere instead of recovering and sending it to the EPA to be destroyed (cause that shit costs money). 
 The EPA has no way to verify who does and doesn't properly recover and dispose of old refrigerant because they don't do regular audits of recover/disposal records. Owners of hvac companies know this and take advantage. Dumbass lazy techs and installers comply. 
 The HVAC industry plays fast and loose with the rules. The whole industry needs stronger measures against this type of behavior and honestly, techs and installers need unions.

"Hi there ents! 
 So I was on my way home from the university and smoked two joints. They got me pretty high and so I still was when arriving at the train-station. 
 I was minding my own business and heard loud voices (I was wearing in-ears), so I turned around and saw a little kitten which was sitting right on the tracks and did not move, it was just meow-ing the whole time. 
 High me did not know how to react and I stood there staring. It was :11 and the train would arrive at :12. I realised what was happening and jumped right on the fucking tracks (1,5meters are a big distance at a [8]), grabbed little kitten and gave it to an old woman standing there as I heard the train coming and already honking. 
 I jumped back on the concrete and the train was there. Maybe 2-3 seconds. 
 The train-conductor was angry as fuck, but the old woman explained everything and also called an animal-ambulance (the kitten was obviously not in a good condition). We waited for their arrival and tried our best to cheer up the kitten. 
 End of story: Many people there honored me after that and I missed the train because I waited for the ambulance so there was enough time to toke one more joint.

"that big rocket shot a few things to the moon. one was a big ship to go to the moon with a little ship to land on the moon included. perhaps you haven't thought too much about it but you don't want to just land your ship on the planet and then ride that thing back, landing on a planet takes a lot of energy and getting there takes a lot as well so two ships allows safety.

"It's such a MASSIVE psychological turn on for me...the mere thought of my wife getting off on me playing with (or even better, fucking) her ass gives me an instant hard on.  I want her to want it and love that she loves it.  She likes for me to lick or finger her ass after oral and/or finger her ass during vaginal sex and, as a bonus, she can cum from just anal stimulation. 
 I like the notion of anal intercourse more than I like anal intercourse.  We rarely go all the way to anal intercourse.  It's a little uncomfortable for her unless she's really drunk and I think vaginal sex feels better.  For me it's like fucking a balloon...uncomfortably tight at the base, and not tight enough inside.  But the sight of her getting into it and rocking back against me makes that just not matter.  :) 
 You go in implicitly understanding that there might be poo, but after nearly 2 years of regular anal play, I've never seen one speck or caught one single whiff of poo.  If anything, it's sweaty, but everybody's crotch gets sweaty.  It's totally clean after a shower, so no worries there.

"So I should preface this by saying this happened a week ago. 
 I had chinese food for dinner the previous night, and I figured I could eat it for breakfast when I woke up the next morning. Instead of just popping the corner of [the container]( or pouring it into a bowl, or any other number of ways to reheat chinese food, I thought I'd poke a hole in the top to vent the steam. Step one of my fuck-up is complete. 
 Begin phase two of my complete fuck-up. I pull one of the sharpest knives we have out of the drawer. I pick up the container. Can you see where this is going? If you have ever tried to do this before, you'd know how rigid the plastic on those containers is. I take the knife, and press it into the plastic while it's in my hand. I keep going, thinking I'd be able to stop the knife from going through the second half of the plastic. Proceed to stage three of my monumental fuckup. The knife rams through the plastic, and through the nice soft fleshy part of my palm. 
 Long story short, got to the hospital, didn't hit my bones, missed my nerves as well. Went to the orthopedic center, and I cut my tendon 2/3rds.

"Got a bunch of them as I bartend in a small bar in a port town (navy boys, fishermen off the boat for the first time in months w a ton of money to spend) and we have no bouncer or door guy. No dishwashers or bar backs either, usually, but that's besides the point. 
 So I was on a precious smoke break and this fight breaks out on the patio. About five dudes push the two aggies apart but the one is a fuckin hulk and just starts pushing through them. I grab him by the collar and push him against the wall (one of the few perks of being taller and heavier than most people). I say something like cut it out and he growls and looks at me ""I'm gonna kill you,"" and gears up to throw a punch. With my hand still on his neck I say ""don't do it, don't punch me."" He screams ""why not"" or something because my next line is ""my arms are longer than yours."" 
 Dude flips and throws his punch. His fist lands about an inch away from my face. He holds it there for a second just kind of looking at his own hand and then suddenly he busts out in this hysterical laughter. Then I start laughing.

"Almost any weight lifting you do, and certainly even more practical, everyday kinda uses of your muscles will involve having to grab something. You can be strong as an ox, but very few actions DON'T involve having to grasp something. Pushing something or fighting is about all I can think of, besides kicking your dog or some fucked up shit, and grip becomes extremely important if the fight gets to the ground.

I used to use the wrist straps for deadlift and cleans, but it got to the point that I was so reliant on it I couldn't dead lift or clean without them without dropping the weight and potentially hurting myself. Or at the very least look like an asshat in the weight room. Even became a problem during pull-ups unless I did them prior to the heavy lifting crap. I've always had princess fairy forearms that are skinnier than most for some reason, but most my friends feel the same way I do about their grip.

"So I just had a weird fucking convo. Some girl I dated for a week back before I was out and still thought I was Bi started talking to me. Asked how I was and I told her the gist of it. ""Oh doing great, been happy lately. Finishing up school and making friends. Living life. I finally came out as gay too"".When I mentioned I came out as gay she gave me the standard ""Oh I'm happy for you!"" and was curious about it. She asked why and I told her women just weren't wowing me like I had thought and it turned out I preffered men when I finally worked up the nerve to admit it. 
 And then said she could  ""turn me straight"" . She also asked if I had a bf (which I told her I don't, because my area is kinda bad for meeting guys). So I told her how it happened. I had just went through a breakup and was lonely. Had always been curious and even dated a guy before, but never acted on anything. Then I met a guy who was a friend of a friend. Went over to his place to hang out and one thing lead to another... 
 When I got to the part about how I'd had sex she asked ""Pitcher or catcher"" (I don't even baseball, but k). I told her honestly. Yeah, she suddenly had to go after that.

"Hello Reddit, this is my first post ever! I've been lurking and just last night I fucked up enough that I figured I'd post it here.
So last night I was binge drinking with a homie and his girlfriend. Well I've had way to much to drink (This is the last thing I remember, no idea how I walked home from his house) and we were all talking about some real heavy shit, bonding over some booze. Well I get all quiet and look at them and say ""You guys are the most nonjudgmental people I know, can I be real with you for a sec?"". They tell me it's no problem and that I can tell them anything their lips are sealed. Well I was all quiet and shy and his girlfriend asks ""What, are you bi? That's fine."" I tell her yes and they were fine with it. 
 Now normally I'd look at this as whatever except for one thing....I'm not bisexual. I'm straight. Why I ""came out"" I still have no idea. I'm running through what I said in my head literally cringing. I'm debating if I should set the record straight that I am not bisexual but at the same time they were cool with it and I shouldn't care what they think anyway. I mean it's not like I'm going to go out and start sleeping with dudes.

"You're still working this angle? 
 First off, you don't need to fucking lie about the numbers.  I can't imagine what kind of goatse-sized orifice you pulled that ""12 Billion dollar"" shit from, but it'd need to be enormous to drag something that wrong out of it. 
 So far, the USPS is down 4.2B for the year, and after closing a few hundred offices around the country, they're projecting a low end of 5B. ([source](  You somehow think there's a possibility they'll lose another  8 billion dollars  in  2 months ? 
 The USPS, like any other business, does well when the rest of the economy is doing well.  Witness: 
 Net income (loss) in millions:
2008 $(2,806)
2007 $(5,142)
2006 $900
2005 $1,445
2004 $3,065
2003 $3,868
2002 $(676)
2001 $(1,680)
2000 $(199)
1999 $363
1998 $550

1995 $1,770
1994 $(913)
1993 $(1,765)

"Woman's Viewpoint: I am a fan of anal when it's done correctly.
My advice for first-timers: Guys, DO NOT try to fuck an asshole like it's a pussy. Just don't. This is the reason girls hate anal (for the most part). The ass is more sensitive and way tighter. Experiment a couple times with a buttplug first to see if you enjoy the sensation. They are THE most underrated sex toy, in my opinion. A plug will get the girl used to the sensation as well as help relax the muscles in the anus (prepping for the buttsecks) and press against the vaginal walls. Translation: tighter vag. Who doesn't want that? Use copious amounts of lube. Like when you think there's way too much and you're going to ruin the sheets, it might just be enough. For that matter, put down a towel. Guys, wear a condom. Helps with the glide and nobody likes shitdick. For the love of dog, do not use any kind of numbing, cooling, his pleasure, her pleasure bullshit. It fucking burns. Have the girl lay flat on her stomach and enter her that way (after having sex with the plug in and removing said plug slowly). It's the easiest and most gentle way to enjoy anal. Go slowly. Once you get the feel for it, raise the ass a little and have the guy give you a reacharound. Prepare for bliss.",1258,"anal is awesome, prep is key, buttplugs ROCK

"Saying these girls are sluts is a really damaging viewpoint to have. 
 I'm interested to know the criteria you used to arrive at that opinion. 
 They're young girls who maybe dress a few years older than is traditional, but that's to make them seem more mature to the intended audience - not to make you find them more sexually attractive - and it's certainly nothing to criticise them for. 
 Incidentally, if you do find them attractive that still doesn't make them sluts. Your prudish attitude to what appears to be something fairly innocuous (to the rest of society) aside, they don't have sex (or even kiss) on TV so how are they sluts? 
 Further still, acting flippantly with the word 'slut' or any similar term is oppressive. You're labelling young girls (and therefore all girls who admire them because they're on TV) in a very negative way. You're saying that because they act in a certain way then we should look down on them, and since the only thing they've done wrong is aggravate your bizzare appeal to Victorian good taste I don't think that's fair.

 I was homeschooled until high school and admittedly socially retarded, and the dudes in PE would give me shit on a daily basis 
 I'm a pretty big dude, but also timid due to extreme sheltering and I like to think a gentle personality. Anyways these guys would make fun of me and stuff for actually running laps and participating and stuff like that 
 I was getting kind of depressed about it and I told my dad who was like ""just beat the shit out of them. sometimes you gotta defend yourself"" 
 So the next time one of them messed with me, I told him that if he didn't stop I was going to kick his ass. He called me a little bitch and so I took him to the pavement, dude had to get about 10 stitches in the back of his head because I punched him into a wall. When they took us into the office I was unscathed but shaking and on the verge of tears(I am pretty timid) and I broke down in front of the assistant principle.

"Men only get their social validation in terms of getting laid when they are like in their late teens and twenties.  When you're like 30 and you've had sex with more people than you can count on both hands you no longer give a shit about sexual gratification.  I think collectively everyone realizes sex is just a thing, much like eating at a great restaurant or enjoying a good movie - it's part of the background and not nearly as important as the shit in the world that really matters - making good friends with good people, having good relationships with your family that you probably neglected in your blind hulking charge for vagina back when you were younger, that sort of thing.  You start realizing experiences that last longer than 5 seconds are more important. 
 To be fair, people will always look for some measurable aspect of life and try to compare it to others in a misguided way to validate their own existence, whether it's how many girls you slept with, to how much money you make, to how big your dick is, etc... and if it's not obvious all of these measurements don't give an accurate measurement of jack shit.

"I absolutely agree it is your right to not have kids. People acting otherwise are annoying, but I put them on the list of other annoyances you have to shrug off as part of life.

 You may be asking yourself, [“The fuck is an inclan?”]( 
 Well, its pretty much Community Night but with less prizes and more drinking. Every Saturday for the foreseeable future for anyone who wants to get in on some drunk tanking or just get away from those  damn pubbies  and join the shenanigans. 
 Most of what we will be doing will be training room based so be prepared to lose some dosh. Activities that will happen include but are not limited too: 
 
 Battle Boats 
 Racing (elc, pz1c, maus?) 
 Cat and Mouse 
 Fight Night (two titans enter the ring one leaves, Ex: Jagzilla vs Deathstar) 
 many more.... 
 
 Anything we do for the night will just be on consensus of the group participating that night. (Last Saturday was multiple rounds of Battle Boats and Battle Bridge.) Many of the events we will run are also seen in Community Night, so get some practice in before the big night or maybe even be a tester for the next ELC track. 
 When:  Every Saturday, after Est/Cst CW 
 Where:  Reddit TS 
 Why:  [Why?]( 
 Events can have prizes if anyone is willing to donate something, terms of winning that prize will be dictated by the person who donated.

"Dude, first off, let me tell you that the only way to get them to fuck off and suck it up is to marry her and make them absolutely aware of her happiness. 
 Sources: My wife is Indian, born in the Philippines. She had to run away under cover of night to be with me, and we've never looked back, but when her parents found out they threatened to kill me, hunt me down, etc. They challenged my honor, and my safety (to which I respond with the proper gentelmanly response of  Come at me, bro. ) and generally made my wife cry on countless occasions. Her mother, after not speaking to her for a year, whom she called on Mother's day, called her a whore (I exploded, and told her what I thought of her, nearly decapitating any chance of a relationship ala Ganesh style) and generally our relationship was a pile of smoldering unsalvageable shit. 
 Skip to a year or so later. Her father finally agrees to come meet me, realizes their daughter is happy, I'm utterly, unabashedly, horrifyingly, deeply, truly in love with her, and I won't let anything stand in the way of her happiness. Not even them. After realizing this, like any good parent, they apologised to me, told me to lose weight, and we now have a relationship. It's not a good one, but it serves. 
 Thats the",1266,"version, but my point is that you basically need to suck it up and realize that you're both going to be in an up-hill battle and there will be plenty of tears, but if your happiness is important to you and her parents would see it impeded for their own racism then there is no good reason to continue repecting their opinion.

"Today was unlike any other day. Being the horny 15 year old I am, I decided to spice things up a bit tonight. I waited the sweet moment for my brother to leave to work so I can proceed with my dirty secret. But today my hand would not do that job. I was too horny for that. I decided to look up some ""homemade sex toys for males"" on YouTube and found one that seemed relatively easy to make. So I grab a ziplock bag, fill it with conditioner, slide it under the couch cushion, and begin my wonderful couch fucking. 
This is where I fuck up. 
It started burning but I ignored it for a few minutes before it became unbearable and decided to just jerk off and slide it in right before I cum. So I'm so close and decide to put it in. 
Now I'm a virgin so I've never felt anything this good in my life before. Anywhoo I didn't realize my grandpa had come upstairs (Everyone else was downstairs). So, here I am pants down at my ankles fucking my couch when I hear the door to downstairs fly open.

"Got one! Back when I was doing fetish work (dominatrix, foot fetish sessions, etc...) I had an interesting fellow bring me his particular kink. He wanted me to pretend I was asleep. Like passed the fuck out, asleep or unconcious. No sex involved, he didn't even request to jack off. He just wanted to touch a woman who wasn't responsive in any way. 
 I would be totally clothed and he would touch my face, legs, arms, hands, feet, torso. He would manipulate my limbs, like fold my arms/legs all different ways, or roll me over. He especially liked lifting my arms up and then dropping them, and since I was ""passed out"" I wouldn't hold up my arms or offer any resistance so they would drop like dead weight. He was particularly fascinated with my ability to just zone out and not take control over my dead-weight arms. 
 If he ever did anything I wasn't ok with (kissing my face, going underneath my clothing, etc) I would start to ""wake up"" and mumble ""no..."" and he would stop that activity. He was very polite about it, always making sure I was comfortable and not in pain from the positions he put my body in.

""Dude, you have cocaine""?

 ""Oh, it keeps the dogs off of it because cocaine doesn't usually smell like lemons"".  Good thing I had my back turned or else he would've seen me silently shitting bricks.

"Interesting?  No.  Painfully less-than-intelligent? Yes.  In Basic Contract law, California likes to fuck up basic non-compete agreements (where an employer will only hire someone if that someone agrees that if they were to leave under any circumstance that they won't go working for a competitor, usually to protect trade secrets like recipes).  So, if Coke were to set up shop and hire people to create new Cokes, they would typically say ""Oh, and if you leave you can't go and tell Pepsi what we're doing here or we'll sue you into oblivion.""  The state of California almost exclusively says ""Sorry, brah, but we can't let you do that.  It's not fair to workers."" 
 It's also really easy to get sued for damn near anything in California.  The construction of their version of the EPA codes makes it ludicrously simple for an individual or a corporation to be sued by anyone for anything?  ""Oh, my neighbor used a red mulch for his/her landscaping and I don't like the color?  I'm going to sue him/her and the mulch company because allowing those red dyes into our eco-system harms the planet.""

"The end of the stent was tied in a knot my bladder so it wouldn't slip out which meant for two weeks I could only pee half way otherwise it felt like a tiny mike tyson was punching my bladder from the insides. I was super excited to get that fucker out so I didn't ask many questions but in hindsight the stirrups should have been a bigger red flag. Once I was in the stirrups the nurse pulled out a big needle-less syringe full of lidocaine and pumped my poor cock full of that burny shit. Once I had recovered from that trauma the doc came in and lubed up the scope/grabby thing. It was the diameter of a pencil and iirc several feet long. This is when panic set in, they weren't going to knock me out, they were just going to reach on up my pee hole and yank the stent out. 
 The stent removal process involved my very hard to understand doctor yelling commands at the nurse as he maneuvered around trying to grab the knot in the stent. Any false move meant that scope banged against my bladder which involved me screaming like a little girl, the nurse apologizing, and the doctor yelling at the nurse to try and clamp down again.

"I was walking down the street today and got stared at by a woman I wasn't attracted to, and I realized something. 
 If a person looks at you with an obvious desire in their manner, and that desire is for something you would not enjoy, then that look is uncomfortable. 
 It's true that in a civilized society one doesn't need to fear some bodily interaction they don't want as much as in a lawless state, but our evolved brains have a hardwired response to this look which is to register ""incoming threat of unpleasant experience coming"". 
 This can be seen when the person desires to hit you, and also when a person desires to fuck you.  In the case of hitting, like if there's someone who's looking at you angrily, it's pretty much all the time that this is going to be unwelcome.  In the case of sex, it depends more on the attractiveness of the person, and one's own state of interest in sexual activity generally. 
 So standing there, waiting for the light to change, and watching this woman edge her way over to the side of the crosswalk I was going to be crossing on, was uncomfortable because that look she was giving me was connected by my brain to the potentiality of her disgusting body all over mine.  The fact that I was a bit stoned didn't help, as being high generally heightens my social anxiety.",1311,"The feeling one gets from having a person looking at them is a sort of toned down, proxied version of what it would feel like to be physically interacting with that person.

"I'm bored, so let me lay it out for you: 
 
 My original comment was about an Elemental tribal deck commanded by Rosheen where I listed 7 spells and 1 creature that might not always work with Genesis Wave. 
 You called Genesis Wave ""really fucking stupid"" based on imaginary Hydras and... not much else. Running instants and sorceries does not automatically make Genesis Wave ""really fucking stupid"" (I'm going to keep quoting you on that, because it was a ""really fucking stupid"" judgment to make). You have basically no information on the ratio of instants/sorceries-to-permanents in the deck, and also chose to ignore the parts about ramp and cost reduction (not to mention Rosheen herself) which often result in Genesis Waves of 20+, in which case a few whiffs or more are fine. 
 Again, your go-to phrase was ""really fucking stupid."" If you can't bring up a point or an argument without  immediately  resorting to profanity and insults, you are going to be regarded as a troll and have your opinions rejected as such.

"First, the actual decision of the british to hand a section of land in the region to Israel came about in the context of decades of political tension/violence. A weakened postwar Britain saw a region with cray-cray Jewish terrorists willing to bomb British hotels and kill random people and realized that it was wasting it's time doing things like detaining Jewish immigrants on Cyprus and basically just said ""lol fuck it not my problem"". 
 Then, the Israelis vastly overstepped the original territorial split around the '48 war, and caused a giant refuge problem by running around to every palestinian village in the area with tanks and implicitly (and in some cases violently) threatening them to leave. That's how israel got such nice borders; it forcibly removed the arabs from their villages. 
 Then the '67 war came and Israel came out of that stupid war (srsly wtf neighboring arab countries) holding the territories the Palestinians had fled to (well, a lot of them went to Jordan but still) and not really knowing what to do with the land and its pissed off, suicide-bomby residents.

I can't get a picture, because I'm on mobile, but the picture it sends you in the email isn't really something you want your Mum seeing. Also, just the name doesn't sound that good. 
 Still, a bright side to everything. I am no longer single, Tiffany and I will go build a life together. Like most good things in life, she's only there when I'm gaming, high, or dreaming, but we can make it work.

 That was when we took it up a notch. This girl went from being a simple, small town sweetheart to being a veritable Glenn Close from Fatal Attraction.

"Here is my little anecdote. 
 This one girl (she is 18, I am 34) I have been talking to as friends online and who I always assumed to be shy started talking to me about how she was looking forward to summer but had a problem... 
 She has a boyfriend, who is cute and sweet and not aggressive enough (thats her description of him and she told me he ain't getting any until she decides) and her problem is that she is planning on hooking up on the beaches this summer, to this effect she bought a new cute swimsuit and she ""has a hard time turning an handsome guy down""... Do note, she claims to still be a virgin (blowjobs dont count). 
 She also went on cam to model the swimsuit for me, and I told her that indeed her boyfriend has a massive problem now... 
 The conversation went on for a bit discussing what kind of guys she would fuck (we talked about some guys we both know), including myself (she said she would fuck me even if I am a bit old for her). Thats about where I blew things (I guess) and lost frame by telling her I liked her (but meh whatever). 
 So basically, her boyfriend ain't getting any (too nice), blowjobs dont count (I'll keep that in mind next time I talk to some girl with a boyfriend), she is planning on hooking up this summer and would like the ""boyfriend problem"" to go away during summer and still not lose him...",1347,Fit girl plans on cheating on nice boyfriend.,45,0.685954749584198,0.209330528974533,0.009542591869831,0.0003096324508078,0.6579824686050415,0.00622667837888,0.0017039070371538,0.0004460799391381,0.1447213739156723,0.0094259679317474,0.0059310183860361,0.0009640647913329,"A girl I have been talking to as friends online and who I always assumed to be shy started talking to me about how she was looking forward to summer but had a problem.

"A LITTLE BACKSTORY:
My Grandma owns a cleaning service. She usually calls my parents and ask them if they'd like a cleaning for free, and knowing my mom she always says yes. They usually clean my downstairs room, which consists of my computer, tv, xbox, drums and all that jazz. 
 THE TIFU PART:
So, at 7:00 I was sleeping soundly in my bed, and awoke to my dog barking at people outside. My mom opens the door and greets the cleaning ladies. No big deal. I was laying there thinking, what if they clean my downstairs room, would they find anything bad? Then it hit me like a like a pile of fuckin' bricks. 
 Last night my ass was really itchy, it was the townhall of itchville. So, I took a paper towel and cranked it up there. I used my finger to really dig it in, twisting and shouting. I pulled it out leaving a point of brownish shit precisely marked on the top. 
 Much better. 
 I then went back to doing what I was doing previously, on the computer playing MC. Got sleepy, and went to bed. 
 Next day (when I'm writing this) 
 The cleaning ladies are going to find a paper towel shaped like Mount Everest, with a dap of shit on the top of it instead of snow, just laying next to my computer. 
 I just heard them go down the stairs, SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT,

"Hello! First post on this subreddit after lurking around for a while. 
 This didn't happen today, it happened 5 years ago when I was in 7th grade.
Okay, so this was the first day of school after summer holiday. I met up with my friends which I hadn't seen for two months. We decided to walk home to one of my friends, let's call him Phil. Okay so Phil here was home alone, his mother and father was at work and they wouldn't come home for a while, the clock was 12pm so we had a few hours of fun. We were sitting in his room talking and he called one of his friends to come over. So the hours went and we were still waiting for his friend to come, and the next part is where I fuck up. So I'm sitting behind his door in a red comfy chair so If people opened the door they couldn't see me and I couldn't see them. So we can hear someone walking up the stairs. And of course stupid me think this is our friend we've been waiting for. So I'm sitting in the chair and I can see the door go up, I quickly get to my feet  and smash the door closed. What I didn't know was that Phil's mother was standing outside the door with broken glasses and a angry face. She opened the door and screamed ""WHAT THE HELL?!?"" I quickly ran out of the room and never came back. Btw, Phil was laying on the floor laughing his ass of when I smashed his mothers face in with the door.",1359,"Smashed my friends mother face in with a door.

 These Wall St protests aren't making significant progress because people are afraid of losing their yachts. They're making progress because in the back of their mind, they know it can come to blood. In the same way, we agree with the law, because in the back of our mind, we remember Waco, and Kent State, and the West Memphis Three, and countless other incidents. So don't make this out to be some bullshit populists use only non-violent means while the government uses only violent means. Neither are true. Both are backed by the threat of violent force. There are differences, like the time to mobilize, the readiness for violence, the scale of the weaponry, etc. But at the end of the day, the reason the fascists don't shoot non-violent protesters en masse is because they know that it will enrage the population to full scale revolt and they will lose their power.

"Sounds like the real advice here is:
1) Have sex before marriage for a few years, and see if it's still as fun as when you first had to tap that ass, and
2) Have a few years of marriage before you have kids. 
 I see comments here and IRL about how getting a divorce is doing the kids a favor... kids suffer too in an unhappy marriage, having step-siblings is an enriching experience, more presents at Christmas as mom and dad try to outdo each other, and hey, kids are just so  amazingly resilient !  Fuck. that. shit. 
 However hard divorce might be on the parents, it's 10x as hard on the kids. Guaranteed. I saw a bunch of friends in middle- and high-school go from being happy, engaged, academically-successful kids, to being apathetic, smoking/drinking/drug-abusing dropouts; you wanna guess what had happened at home during that inflection point in their lives? 
 I strongly agree that good, frequent sex is vital to any relationship worth having, and it's great that you and your new wife get the chance to have weekend-long fuckfests (my wife and I do too, now that our kid is old enough to overnight with friends and her grandparents, and man did life just improve!).

"How about this:  don't  defend Assange. Let his lawyers defend Assange, let the prosecutors attack Assange, let the judges judge Assange, and let the judicial system do its work. 
 I agree with the philosophy of Wikileaks, and I'd really like to see more (forced) transparency in governments worldwide. On the other hand, I think Assange is an ego-maniacal cunt, but that doesn't matter in this case. 
 What matters is that just maybe he might have fucked up. Maybe he is guilty, and he did rape or molest people. Maybe he was set up by the CIA, Spetznaz or fucking Fox News, who knows. What matters is, he is being sued. Would you let a cop walk out of a hearing because he's a cop? No? Of course you wouldn't.
""But cops get off scott-free all the time! The system is flawed!"" - Then don't play along with them. You know it's fucked up, so take the moral high ground on this one. Let Assange have a fair trial, let him explain what happened, and  then  decide if you should or shouldn't defend him. 
 Yes, Assange faces a risk here; of being falsely convicted, or getting killed before, during, or after his trial. However, that doesn't mean he can blatantly ignore the rules. If he's innocent, he deserves a fair trial and subsequent release. If he's guilty, he deserves a fair trial and a suitable conviction.

So I'm chillin with her, probably at a [7] or [8] at this point and I notice in the circle next to us is my ex from a few months ago. It wasn't a bad break up or anything, we were still chill, we just realized we both were going to do our own thing and we didn't need to be together anymore. If I was sober I probably woulda said hi, talked for a few minutes and that would be that. But because I'm high as fuck I start bugging out thinking if she sees me with this girl she'll somehow immediately know we're gonna fuck and be pissed. So I make an excuse to leave and go meet up with some of my boys chillin in a different spot. Kinda glad I left anyway cuz its about to be 4:20 and we smoked a couple blunts together on the hill and watch the huge cloud of smoke rise up over the commons as everyone lights up at the same time.

 Excess calorie consumption is perfectly relevant to ketogenic diets, it's just calories in the form of  excess fat  that  can not  be efficiently utilized for gluconeogenesis is excreted out as ketone bodies. If someone has a basal metabolic rate of 2000 cal/day and is consuming 4000 calories a day on a keto diet their weight is either going to go up or  at best  not increase.

"I work at a fast food restaurant and I have stories like this happen to me on a weekly basis. However the worst incident was when I rang a guy up for a massive burger with no ketchup.

"YES.  I used to work at an after school day care for K-5.  I was in high school at the time, so the issue wasn't as big, but it definitely crossed my mind.  I truly loved working with kids, it really made me feel good about myself having people look up to me.  It was truly one of the only fulfilling things I have done.  But when the weird started to come around, I felt like I was being looked at like a convict, and not someone there to look after their kids. 
 Also, I worked as a Lifeguard for 4 years at an upper class private swim club.  It was ""the cool thing to do"" for rich white parents to have their kids take swim lessons at our club.  Whenever I would approach a child to tell them something, like, hey, don't dive in head first there or you will fuck up you skull, or, don't throw rings at that girl because you'll smash her face, parents would rush up, hold their kids, and look at me like I was trying to molest them or something.  Anytime a female lifeguard would do the same thing, the parents would praise them, and look at them as a hero.  It made me feel really bad, because I really liked what I did and was really there to ensure the safety all around. 
 I know these are kind of out of the ordinary circumstances, considering the area and demographic I was serving, but it made me think twice about getting into working with children as a profession(which I didn't).",1391,"When I helped kids, I was a molester, when girls helped kids, they were Jesus with a vagina.",92,0.6653478741645813,0.9256607294082642,0.0793226584792137,0.024195808917284,0.6719445586204529,0.671478271484375,0.1023723483085632,0.0028833309188485,0.3179968595504761,0.6287592649459839,0.2265325188636779,0.0850107669830322,"I used to work at an after school day care for K-5.

"Ahhh back when I played WoW (i quit back in November) I had just freshly turned 80 on my prot/ret paladin and had a bit of scrub gear for both specs. I decided to PUG 10-man Naxx as ret with prot fill-in in case they needed it. I don't even think I was def capped yet. 
 We get to 4 horsemen and I'm thrown in the back to tank one of them. I have a much higher gear paladin healer with me (I think he was in all T8) and right as the raid starts, someone fucks up. I have no idea what happened but all I hear is ""Wipe it"" 
 Fuck.That. 
 All that's left is my holy paladin, a warrior tank, and me in my scrub tank gear. We keep up with switch offs, blow everything we have to when we need it, and keep on going. The entire raid is already back at the doors waiting for us to wipe so we can have another go. The holy paladin gets to many stacks and dies off.

 Then, as luck would have it, my T7 chest drops. However, the raid leader (warrior tank) says there's a bug and he'll toss in a ticket for the GMs to mail it to me. He then asks me to leave so a friend of his can step in…. =(

"In high school I was almost mugged for my bike, but my friend saved the day. 
 It was late at night, after a basketball game or something, my buddy and I were riding our bikes in front of our school. We were about to head home when a couple of the ""gangster"" kids walked up to us, big guys that could have destroyed us with their fists alone. One of them demands my friends bike, the bike he had been riding for years. My friend stood up and gave in easily, eyes to the ground and tears starting to well up. The other kid walked up to me, grabbed my handlebars and stood right in front of me, shouting and screaming at me. I told him to go fuck himself and let go of my bike. I don't know what I was thinking, my adrenaline was surging and I was about to get the ass beating of a lifetime, but I just wouldn't back down. The other kid walks up and they start puffing up and getting ready to jump me, when another friend of mine rolls up shouting at them. 
 This friend lived less than a block away and treated me like a brother, but he wasn't that big and I didn't expect much help from him realistically. Not until he got closer and pulled a 12 gauge shotgun up from his side. He got about 5 feet from the guys before they realized what was happening, pants shitting fear overcame them and they booked it down the street, leaving our bikes for us.

"Dude, it's just a case. I get that you are only referring to the features of the case, and have no issue with people wanting it for aesthetics. But it's a case. The main function of a case is aesthetics. 
 I don't care about aesthetics, so I put my computer in a cardboard box. It has more features than any case you linked, because I just glue on other pieces of cardboard as my system expands. 
 My point is, buying a case is most importantly about what it looks like on the outside, as that is what will be seen all day everyday. If your biggest issue is that for the form factor, cases exist that are cheaper and have good features, than did you really have to make a PSA about it? Everyone knows there are tons of cases out there. No one buys an ITX mobo and thinks that the smallest case they'll be able to find is a Prodigy. That never happens. 
 I see people buying $80 mid tower cases on here all the time. Should we just tell everyone to stop, and just buy a nice $40 xigmatec? I have one  of those, and it has a lot of great features many of those more expensive cases lack. But I'm not going to go around telling everyone to stop looking at those cases. 
 So to end this whole shpeal, can everyone stop spamming prodigy builds with stupid questions like ""You know there is also this case you could buy"", and ""Not sure why you're using a Prodigy, did you even do research?"".

"So I'm pretty upset right now. I (26M) just found out I have genital herpes and I think I got it from my GF (24F) of 6 months. 
 She is the only person I have had sex with since March 2014 and I have always used condoms in the past with other women. My SO and I began with condoms, but stopped using them about 1-2 months into our relationship. 
 I am out of country for the holidays but am returning in a couple days and I need to confront her about this. I'm not sure what scenario I'm more worried about: If she knows she had herpes and didn't tell me or if she doesn't know and thinks that I'm some dirty bastard that gave it to her. 
 If she knew and didn't tell me, I would be incredibly hurt and betrayed. We both made a decision to not wear condoms and she should have at least warned me about this so we could have taken preventative measures, LIKE WEARING CONDOMS. 
 If she doesn't know, she's going to think that I gave it to her. This is going to become the most awkward conversation of all time. I'm going to have to tell her to get tested and she's going to be positive. 
 Either way, my relationship is about to go through a fucking blender and this may shatter it. I feel sick thinking about it. I feel sick knowing that I now have herpes for fucking life. 
 Anyways, any advice on how to approach this situation or any anecdotes of people in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.",1407,I have herpes and my girlfriend most likely gave it to me.

 I'm not trying to insinuate that Israel is perfect, far from it. However, the fact of the matter is that the Jewish people deserve a state, and the Palestinian leadership will not ever allow that to happen. Similarly, the Palestinians deserve a state, and they are currently refugees. Excuse me, but the rest of Middle East is controlled by Islamic governments! Maybe they could help their brothers out?! 
 Oh, and who was there before the Israelis? The British. And who was there before them? The Ottoman Empire. And who was there before them? Well, I dunno, but I can tell you that Jews maintained a presence throughout history, along with other groups (like the Philistines, who are probably the ancestors of the Palestinians). After all, there's more than one indigenous tribal group within very small areas in America.

 We were located down the street from a high school, so we had high school kids come in all the time during the lunch rush. This one girl would come in every day and try to flirt with me or other people to get free shit. This kind of stuff doesn't work on me, and she didn't like it. 
 So she comes in one day, and she asked for a Blue Cheese cup AFTER she had already paid for her slices. I told her ""That'll be 75 cents."" She flipped shit on me saying ""WHY DO YOU ALWAYS CHARGE ME?! OTHER PEOPLE GIVE IT TO ME FOR FREE?!"" and just proceeded to go on this rant. 
 I turn to John and I give him the ""Can I handle this?"" motion. He gave me the ""do whatever"" shrug. And I just started going off on her.

"Because there is a special victim mentality that the media gives to a white on black hate crime. everyone wants to hear a story about the big bad opressor because its easy to dislike someone who society portrays and more stable and wealthy. 
 Hell yeah i get furious at stuff like this. I got my ass kicked all the way through middle school because of my skin color. Am I a racist? No. I cant stand fucking bigots. 
 but see, it was easy for the black kids in my school to hate me. It was easy to dislike me. Social roles put blacks in a lower standing than whites as view by the populous. As the minority, they are seen as having less, when it is actually the problems in certain areas, cities, and neighborhoods that compound the issue with entertainment and family values. 
 But at my schools and neighborhood, they could take out that frustration. i believe that hate comes from many sources, but can we admit that its not a stretch of the imagination that i got wailed on because of the illogical view that i was somehow superior because of my skin?

"Conversation with the young lads from work got me thinking about this... 
 The word SLUT is a tough one because of how it's used. I hate the negative use of the word slut.  I always have.  It's a word used to denigrate someone whose characteristics we all really want for ourselves. 
 Sluts are women who are sexually liberated (which men typically prefer) in that they are typically more sexually outgoing, available, experimental and oft time, more fun (which men typically prefer). 
 The problem comes when the woman decides to have sex with other people, people who aren't you.  She goes from being great in bed to a dirty slut.  I remember a statement an old fellow told me once.  ""Men are are all pigs and all women are sluts and bitches.  A slut will sleep with anyone.  A bitch will sleep with anyone but you.""  It made me think. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING but the issue of sharing, attachment, etc. are a problem especially when we are younger. 
 I have always thought it was better used as a naughty word between lovers in the form of dirty talk. After all, do we not want the women we are having sex with to embody the traits of what most of us consider sluts or slutty? Do you want a prude in the bedroom or an enthusiastic slut? 
 It can be used to describe men but less so. Either way, is it really a bad thing? 
 What do you think? What do you really really really think about sluts? The use of the word? Do you want your SO to be your slut?",1456,Slut! I love sluts. Bad name for a great thing.

"I was inebriated as hell one night and my girl's cat hops up on the couch demanding some love.  I scratch under his chin, I scratch his ears and he turns around because he's one of these cats that likes to be ""paddled""  (a whole story in itself).  [He likes for people to slap his butt. ]( 
 So....I oblige him and I thought it would be funny to surprise him.  I jokingly gave him a light karate chop to the back of his legs and I a light mist of something hit my face and arm.  I looked at my arm and noticed these brownish droplets on my arm. 
 Immediately this overwhelming stench I had never smelled before overcame me and I started to gag.  I start to try to breathe through my mouth.  When I took a breath, I felt that there were droplets on my lips and the smell was so acrid, I could fucking taste it.  GOD it was horrid.

"This is probably going to get buried but god I always get harassed by gay guys and it’s really annoying. The most recent 3 times: 
 
 I was at a house party and the guy whose house it was passed out down stairs, I decided to go get into his bed and sleep there.

 Sat waiting for my girlfriend to finish a meeting that she was in, then this middle aged guy came up to me and sat next to me then started talking to me asking me how I am and what not, then he asked me if I was gay, I said no, He then asked me if I would like to try being gay with him, I said no, He asked me if I had any friends in the local area that are gay, I said yes, He asked me where they lived I said no and kept creeping closer and closer to me whilst asking me to be gay but then my girlfriend came out of the building and I just got up and left with her.

"Hey mates 
 I'm a longtime hardcore fapper who was not able to get hard from real women for a while, which was pretty depressing. I was subscribed to nofap and could not identify myself with these people telling me that they are able to hook up girls because they didn't masturbate for 6 months. 
 Finally I searched reddit for PIED and found this sub. And suddenly I accepted myself to be addicted to porn. I have a huge library of porn and enjoyed it nearly everyday. On some days three times in 2 hours.
Now I'm trying to get rid of that but it's fucking hard. I can do without porn for up to a week but then I give up because I only think about my favourite scenes, asses, boobs and and. Masturbating to porn after a week is always amazing so it's even harder to go on for a longer break.
Especially when I'm depressed or stressed I'm in danger to fall back because I'm lurking for any good feeling distracting me from my sorrows. 
 I quit smoking cigarettes and quit smoking weed in the past so I know how to handle addiction, but it fucking scares me how watching porn can be the same addictive as drugs were to me. 
 It was always porn, not masturbating. Now I know that, I hate it because porn is so fucking great and I will miss it, the same as I missed the weed. 
 But otherwise, as things look like I'm starting a new relationship soon and I want to have sex with that girl, so there's no choice. No addiction is strong enough for me not to handle.",1459,"Porn is addictive like weed, it's great and not easy to give up, but not impossible.

So the third event/rave/party I went too was Nocturnal Wonderland '08 in San Bernardino aka San Berna-doo-doo. Now if you have never been to one of these events, its pretty much a drug fest lol, think woodstock of the new millennium. So I took a few pills and started to come down at around 2am or so. My inebriated as was like I NEED MOAR!!!!! So me and my bestfriend go off to look for mollys(almost pure mdma capsules). We find this clean cut guy who says he has mollys and I'm like SCORE!!!!! lets do this shit, how much. He gives me a decent price and I say i'll pick up 5 caps(~$125 worth) As soon as I say this his eyes light up. He then says hold on and out of the blue starts arguing with this random guy who came out of the wood work. So I'm waiting and I notice they are arguing about absolutely nothing, Its almost like they are faking it. All of a sudden this random dude comes up behind me and wispers in my ear ""this guy is a narc, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE DUDE."" Now while this guy is whispering sweet nothings in my ear my homegirl starts arguing with the guy for taking too long, I promptly grab her and say lets go.

"As an Australian, I'd just like to say that  most Australian's aren't fucking idiots like Tony Abbot . 
 A lot of people in other countries think that we are racist and selfish.  This is not the case.  Of course there are some Australians that agree with Tony Abbot and all his ideas,  but most don't . The stuff about asylum seekers is fucking ridiculous, and this opinion is shared by the majority of Australians. The same goes for a lot of other stuff Abbot has done. 
 About carbon tax - people didn't like that because they were lied to. They were told that carbon tax wouldn't happen, and it did, and instead of actually looking into it people became instantly outraged. Unfortunatley, it's true that a large portion of Aussies hate carbon tax, but it's also true that carbon tax was a good thing. Again, not all Australians think carbon tax was bad but unfortunatley a lot do and that's a shame, but I want anyone who's ignorant enough to group us all together to know that  we are not all racist/selfish/stupid . 
 I'm sure a lot of you already know all this. But it's been bugging me for a while and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to state my opinion on the matter and to show anyone who believes in the Australian sterotypes listed above that they're wrong.

"I'm tired of masturbating. I've been fapping since i was 12 years old and i'm tired of turning towards my computer instead for sexual pleasure instead of just living a life in the real world. This is turning into a very cliche nofap post but halfway through my first semester of college and i don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything i thought i would socially. 
 I was homeschooled, and in my senior year began dating a very aggressively sexual older girl. My parents were very against it because of a 3 year age gap, but they permitted us to be friends. Every day for the better half of a year she would constantly be trying to text sexually or skype or facebook chat about sex, constantly nagging for attention and threatening to break up if i refused. I got completely blinded and stopped seeing old friends, as she slowly became my entire social life, because she had none prior to me. I had never had a girlfriend and had some SERIOUS confidence issues, so was surprised and shocked when she wanted me to fuck her. 
 After I eventually began listening to EVERY important figure in my life telling me that I am an attractive, skilled, intelligent and talented individual, and MUCH better than she deserved I mustered the courage to end the relationship.

"Was buying some herb from a trusted and well known dealer but he was at a party and just told me to park across the street while he finished things up with someone else. So here I was sitting in my car with the windows rolling down, just chillin, and I heard someone say something but it was muffled and figured it was a drunk person from the party. Then I hear the voice again but it's more clear and it said something along the lines of ""HEY WTF DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING."" I then notice that the house across the street that I was parked by had a man and a woman standing outside. 
 The woman was very obese and pretty gross looking. The man had a wife beater on and acne scars all over his face. He looked to be on some drug (My guess was meth because it was pretty common in my town.)

Since we are  relative  strangers to one another and I have no vested interest in your well being, I will tell you give you a man's sincere objective opinion, but probably just ask clarifying questions. 
 If you haven't changed weight since you started fucking/dating this person he may be an ass for saying what he did...  Or more likely than not, the glow of your new relationship wore off and/or he feels more comfortable with you now enough to tell you about the things he may have been silent about initially be cause of his interest in fucking you.  You are quite young and this is pretty much  how it goes in college... 
 As an aside a small point to be made is that 130 pound toned woman looks very different from a 130 pound out of shape woman of the same height, so to play devil's advocate here, just saying your weight hasn't changed doesn't mean your appearance hasn't... 
 But, I don't see him going out of his way to make a point to talk about this with you (since you mention you had to drag it out of him to get him to admit there was something wrong) so I can't get behind this talk of him  controlling  you that other people are jumping on - though telling you he's not happy with your weight (not nice to hear but fair) and telling you to lose weight are different things (kind of a dick move and not really super productive)",1507,"He sounds like failry insensitive but less like a failed state are more just like a typical college bro who isn't the white knight you expected him to be, he isn't as attracted to you as he once was because of  reasons  and now he's losing interest.  It happens. 
 
 Now, question time; Has he gained weight, altered his appearance, started working out, etc?  Is he hanging out with new friends, does he have a new chick or something he's been hanging out with who might be showing him attention or something?  It may be a  the grass is always greener  type of a situation, or just influence of some new circle of friends if its really not about you. 
 
 Also, is it possible he's projecting?  Does he have like schoolwork or personal issues possibly getting him down?  Family troubles, drugs, etc?  There are plenty of things that may cause his behavior to change that could be totally unrelated to you but that he may be using you(r relationship) as an outlet for.

"I know there's science and stuff to back all of it up [but fuck science, I'll believe what I want]."" 
 Well congratulations, you're capable of feeling happy  and  outright rejecting evidence! What a specimen you are! 
 In seriousness, just because you can find something to cheer yourself up when you're a bit bummed doesn't mean people with depression can. Depression should probably just be understood as ""the inability to feel happy or much of anything for long periods at a time"" to the general public. Quite frankly, people thinking that they were 'depressed' when they just had a shitty or cloudy day and they cheered themselves up with ice cream or working on their car,  kind of irritates the living fuck out of those of us who have been depressed or understand depression . Especially when people admit that they understand there's actual evidence (you know, science) to support the claim that they don't have a clue what they're talking about, because all they're using is  personal and anecdotal evidence , and I hate to break it to you but the plural of anecdote is not 'data'. 
 So yes, you can cheer yourself up when you're feeling a bit morose when it's gloomy, cold, or you've had a shit day. Good for you. Just be aware that the science you just blew off has actual evidence that some people can't feel happy      any day of the week , or when they do it's still like the mute button has been pressed on life, so it's a really watered down color of happy that some people might not even recognize.",1514,"Your anecdote means nothing, anti-science happy plebe.",54,0.8393691182136536,0.1741518825292587,0.010192041285336,0.000165942707099,0.6980020403862,0.0018585534999147,0.0019212381448596,0.0003607220714911,0.3041260242462158,0.0097007546573877,0.0083405207842588,0.0008261115872301,"Just because you can find something to cheer yourself up when you're a bit bummed doesn't mean people with depression can.

"This fuck up actually happened about a month ago. 
 I was at work and my coworkers looked for me telling me some guy was here to repossess my car. This same thing happened a few months ago so I thought he was joking with me. Needless to say, he was not joking. I missed making a payment and made payment arrangements with my bank by leaving three separate messages about it with my loan officer, however when I called about this after my car had been taken away, he said he never received the messages. 
 The same car had been repossessed a few months ago due to me losing my job and having no savings. I negotiated to get the car back and I had to borrow a couple thousand dollars to do so for all the fees and back payments. 
 In the month since I've had the car repossessed the second time, I was able to buy another car. However, I got into a pretty bad accident within less than a week of having it. 
 Now, I'm in the worst financial position I've ever been in my life. My parents aren't able to help as my step dad lost his job last month. I've had a decent job since I got fired a few months ago but I've been told that if I want to stay with the company, my salary is being cut. I think it may be a sign that I may be let go. However, the business I'm in has a motto - you're hired to be fired. There's a pretty quick turnaround for jobs in my line of work. I can barely afford to live as it is.

"Saying ""pedophilia is ok as a fetish"" and we should just leave them alone as long as they don't get caught fucking a kid is just stunningly naive. 
 Have you never been angry at someone, so much that you just wanted to punch them in the face? Never? Im sure everyone has at some point in their lives. Are you saying these people have a mental illness and having these urges is not okay? Im sure you are confronted with the urge to steal at many moments in your life. Im sure you have also look at someone and had the urge to want to have sex with them, or touch them. 
 You seem to think all pedophiles are like psychopaths, and their every waking moment in front of another person is mental torture to not gut them alive. A psychopath has these urges, but they also have little empathy for anyone and the only thing holding them back is being punished. Pedophiles are just like anyone else, mostly. Unlike psychopaths, they do care for the well being of others, and raping someone for us is the same as raping kids for them. They would be absolutely disgusted with themselves if they ever did it, and even the idea of raping a child against their will is as disgusting, or possibly more disgusting than raping an adult is for us.

"Hey Reddit. I looked at the FAQS but it didn't have this scenario in it. 
 So my boyfriend and I were having sex a couple of hours ago. I was laying on my stomach and my boyfriend was coming in from behind (lazy doggy). We used a condom and I am not on the pill. My boyfriend pulled out and finished in the condom. 
 He had laid on my back for a minute as we caught our breath. When he got off, I rolled over onto my left side...and the condom came with me. It was on my butt cheek. He was laying on my back and the condom either stuck to me and came off afterwards and he didn't notice. Or my vagina had the tip of the condom still in me and I pulled the condom off him when I rolled over. 
 I ended up getting cum on my butt checks. The cum was contained in the condom, it just leaked on the bed and my ass. I don't think I need the morning after pill because he didn't cum inside of me. But in all honesty, I am a huge worry wart and nothing like this has ever happened before. I start thinking things like, ""what if it ran down my butt and boom pregnant"". Which the odds of that are unlikely. Idk I feel sticky in my butt crack even though I showered and everything. But that could be the lube. 
 I feel like if cum got inside of me, I would know. There was nothing leaking out of me. I try to keep track of my fertile days though an app. I have typically a 26 day cycle. I was on day 9. So my phone says I'm entering the fertile window, which makes me a little nervous. But I'm not supposed to ovulate until Friday. (it's Monday night).",1541,"Doing lazy doggy, boyfriend and in the condom. The condom somehow landed on my butt cheek and leaked on me.

"Today I fucked up by trying to do craft work involving my heat gun at my desk at work. 
 I work in a call centre and over night and during the evenings there are only one or two people on. There aren't many calls so operators usually read books and play games on their phones after hours, my poison of choice was working on craft and cosplay props. My manager does not approve of this habit.
Tonight I was using my trusty heat gun to do finish up some thermoplastic work, plugged into one of the unused sockets on the wall I was happily plodding along, nearly complete when suddenly there's a flash of light, smoke and heat and my gun is dead and my crisp business shirt is now very (probably permanently) singed in a large area of my chest. 
 The UPS' we have plugged into all the computers in the room start beeping and screaming at me. I've successfully tripped the power and now have called in the offsite engineering guys to come make sure I didn't do any lasting damage. Small mercy that I didn't set off the smoke alarm because that would have been an expensive mistake as the fire department are summoned to my workplace as soon as that happens. 
 In other news, I have no idea where the nearest fire extinguisher is and feel that's definitely what we should be talking about, not the fact I broke half the room I work in.

"I worked as a cell phone technician a  few years ago and on one particularly awful day was left solo with an onslaught of customers.  Due to the amount of phones that needed replacement and the ensuing steps to do so, when I finally got to the point of being able to execute the exchanges the wait was at an hour to receive them. 
 One particularly ornery dickbag came into the store and demanded that his phone be replaced.  He had been sent from the other store so I expected him, but the attitude had to go.  I advised him that I would need a few minutes to complete this though with a smile on my face.  I estimated it would take me about an hour. 
 At this point he began to yell at me and, between the company and this day, I had enough.  I stood up and told him, ""Sir, I am here by myself right now.  There are several people awaiting replacements as well and the wait is about an hour.  If you don't like it then you can go fuck yourself."" 
 The sales people on the floor heard me.  The customer went red and screamed that this is just not right and we can't treat people like that.  My response was to tell him ""Dude, fuck off.  I don't need your shit right now."" 
 He left in a huff of anger without his phone. 
 I got talked to, but kept that job until I actually requested to be laid off.

"If she did nothing, she wouldn't be acting upset and crying about it.

"Once when I was living in the French Quarter in New Orleans, it was Mardi Gras and I was hanging out in a bar a few blocks off of Bourbon with a friend and his buddies from out of town. I notice this guy stumble into the bar with two women that look like hookers...they're all over him and they push him towards the ATM. 
 A common scam is that hookers will find a drunk guy and make some excuse to get them to go to an ATM to watch them put in their pin. They take that guy somewhere, he passes out, then they empty his account as much as they can. 
 He steps up to the ATM in the bar and I pretend I'm his best friend - ""Hey?! Where did you come from!? How's it goin'!!"" and I tell the ladies I have to borrow him for a minute. 
 Once I grab him away I ask him if he knows what's going on and if he wants to be here - he tell me he doesn't know how he ended up with these girls (he was pretty blitzed but coherent) so I ask him where his hotel is, tell him it's out the door, so many blocks over and up, and to run out the door when I tell him to. 
 So many minutes later when the hookers realize he's not with me anymore they're like ""Where did your friend go?"" and I tell them I don't know, he probably left. 
 Then they start threatening me ""I'm gonna go get my pimp and you're gonna get fucked up..."" blah blah blah and I go ""Bitch, please. This is my neighborhood. I know half the people in this bar who are watching you threaten me right now. It''s Mardi Gras. There are cops on every corner. GTFO""

"When I was 19 I was quite effeminate and my girlfrind at the time was really concerned that I was actually gay (her schooltime sweetheart came out the day that he split up with her). Anyway, throughout this relationship that I had with her I was told by various people that she was cheating on me and, supposedly, sucking a lot of cock for drinks when she was on nights out. As a trusting boyfriend I dismissed this as bullshit and, although it made me a little crazy, I just got on with the relationship until I one night caught her involved in a heavy petting session with some stranger whilst she was on a night out with me. 
 I reacted pretty badly, scared the life out of the poor guy and dumped my ex on the spot (despite her repeated claims that it was a one off and that I was the only one for her etc (seriously!)). 
 So, skip to a couple of years later and I'm on a night out with a group of friends and we're leaving when the ex comes over and flirtatiously asks if she can come back to mine. I agreed that she could come back but warned her that my friend was staying over and that he was staying in my room (I still lived with my Mum at this point) so anything that happened in regards of intimacy was likely to be a three way thing. 
 Being the classy chick that she was, she didn't even blink and just agreed to come back to mine. So, following a cab ride to mine later.

Some douchy ele shammy named ""Uchia"" ragged at me all dungeon after I pointed out he broke a rogue sap  with a chain lightning, using it before the tank even really pulled- not that it was a big deal at our level but I suppose I could of  been condescending, but after that it was ""LOL CHAIN LIGHTING IS MY MAIN ATTACK STUPID""""fail healz"" ""EPIC FAIL"" ""NUB HEALZ"" ""PATHETIC HEALER"" etc etc. Admittedly, I don't do well with being yelled at, so I wasn't quite on the ball (had the chat box open and did the stupid ""Well I'm s222224442244222wasdasdad thing-.-) when the bear tank immediately  goes and pulls huge and wipes in the courtyard (SM), of course that's my bad for the wipe (it was, I should of ignored douchbag from the getgo), and pretty much everyone starts in on how much I suck.  After we get back up tank los's me around the corner of the crypts, pulls huge and went down quick so we wiped again, and dick shammy had  a fucking field day with that-""EPIC.FAIL."" ""What's more pathetic that this guy? This guy healing!""  ""Don't worry tank bro I'll heals for you.""""UMADBRO?""
UGHHH. I was really enjoying healing too. I'm a 20 year old women and I cried because I was so fucking frustrated. Stupid, I know.
So I left after the bear pulled the boss.

"When I was about 21 or 22 I was out with a friend who had this titty bar he sold coke (I think) out of. So we're hanging out in this country ass Alabama dive and having an o.k. time when for some reason we go to leave.  For some reason my friend tells me to drop this chick off at a certain hotel. 
 Now at this point I should mention I had this 1911 Colt .45 that I carried like a damn idiot thinking I was a real badass self-protectin' mother fucker. 
 So we show up at this hotel and go up to the room.  Dude cracks the door, takes one look at me and yells at the chick I had came with, ""I thought I told you no dicks in this room!""  So me being a drunken dumbass, I start fingering the semi-automatic life sentence in my belt line, smiling like a fool and blubbering something about how ""It's all good I'm friends with so and so"". 
 Next thing I hear? ""Hey yo Platinum, get my pistol"" 
 So me and the chick head back to my car and when we get there I all pull the .45 out, chamber a round and get ready to unload if I see that fat black dude coming around the corner... Thank you so much, wherever you are Mr. 2-Bit Pimp for not doing that! 
 We then meet up with the friend who sent me on this fool's errand and he gets upset that that chick is still with me and tells me quite forcefully to take her back. 
 As we pull back onto the street Ms. Second Thoughts Whore says something about not wanting to go back and I felt bad for her and asked if there was anywhere she could go.

"Like most fuck ups this happened yonks ago (2 months to be exact). So my school was invited to a national competition and they had to pick a group of students to represent the school. Most of them aren't important except for me and Edward. 
 We arrive at the destination and proceeded to take showers and going to sleep. Us being gentleman allowed the others to take the showers first, there were 2 shower cubicles with curtains. Anyway they all take their shower me and Ed go in to take ours. We walk in and its fucking steamy, it was like being in a bloody sauna. We decided to soldier on and take our showering dousing ourselves with the glorious hot water. 
 Now this is where the fuck up happens, the combination of 8 boys taking a hot shower must of triggered the alarm. The alarm went off, blaring like a motherfucker. Me and Ed stuck our heads of the curtains stared at each other and bolted. We spotted one bathrobe hanging on the hook and mentally challenged each other for it. Me being taller and closer I grabbed and bolted out of the room with shampoo still present. I ran out of the building onto the lawn and watched for any flames. (We didn't know we caused it as of then). Many people were there such as the teachers supervising us and a group of Year 8 girls standing there. 
 Then all of a sudden bursting through the doors Ed comes bolting towards us just in his boxers. Of course we saw it and laughed our asses off with the teachers telling him to put some clothes on.

"A lot of atheists today are loosing the real benefit of not believing in God by being assholes. The assholishness has to do with the fact that we live in a world that is heavily bias towards belief in God. Atheists tend to draw a line in the sand between themselves and believers (believers generally doing the same), and label everyone on the other side as some level of ""sheeple"". 
 I think this is negating the biggest benefit atheism has to offer. The thing that is generally so shitty about religion is the way it divides up the world. This person doesn't believe Allah is God. This one doesn't believe that Jesus died for our sins. So I am different, I'm right and they're wrong. Who the fuck knows and who the fuck cares. No matter how religious people boil it down, it draws battle lines. These battle lines make it impossible to truly love people- there's always some reservation.  Atheism gets rid of these walls, but a lot of us decide to build them back up. 
 Maybe the average atheist doesn't go door to door with a pamphlet with the title ""The Afterlife"", followed by blank pages. But the fact that many of us turn around and bitch on the internet about how retarded believers are is a symptom showing the walls that are present in our minds. Atheists like Richard Dawkins (who wants to call atheists ""brights"") are wasting a huge gift that their mind has given them. Because of events that have shaped their minds and how they perceive the world, atheists have less holding them back from loving the world, but instead they build the walls right back up.

"Fuck no. Unless they're a danger to themselves or others then there is no legitimate reason to force somebody to receive psychiatric care. 
 I'm a director's designee in Oregon—I have the qualification to put a 72 hour hold on an individual for mental health concerns—and that's basically the standard for holds. The individual has to be an imminent threat to themselves and/or others—the threshold is actually pretty high and the individual has to be very symptomatic—before I can put them ""on hold"" and have them transported to a hospital for evaluation and treatment. The hold is for up to 72 hours. In that time the individual is evaluated and receives crisis treatment (if necessary). If they continue to be dangerously symptomatic they might be asked if they want to go on a voluntary diversion—they remain in the hospital for up to 30 days for treatment. 
 The next step is ""commitment"" where the individual is brought to a court and a judge who specializes in mental health commitments listens to testimony from mental health professionals, family, hospital staff, community members and so on and then determines if an individual is to be committed to a state hospital (or local psych ward). This commitment is up to 6 months and is re-evaluated at the end of this time. 
 I have been to several commitment hearings as a witness and the threshold is very, very high because the individual is  literally  having many of their rights taken away from them. Requirements are usually a known history of not participating in treatment, engaging in dangerous activity, and so on.

"I love my girlfriend. She is fucking gorgeous, funny, smart - she's the real deal. I'm going to marry her one day. I've never met someone so compatible with me. 
 However, there's something that's been nagging at me for quite some time. We have fairly vanilla sex. It's great - but it's pretty standard. I want to explore sexually and I want to involve other people. The idea of going to something like a sex party, or having a threesome turns me on quite a bit. Heck, just WATCHING my girlfriend have sex with a girl is a huge fantasy. 
 Here's a short list: 
 
 I want to explore threesomes. Even just doing it once is fine.  
 I want have someone watch me fuck my girlfriend (guy or girl) 
 I want to go to crazy sex parties. Maybe a swinger party - or some sort of orgy.  
 
 I want to do all these things WITH her. Her being part of it is an integral part of my fantasies. I want to explore our sexuality together. I want us to tag-team and seduce a girl together. God, that seems like it would be so fun. 
 But the problem is, how do I bring this stuff up? She's revealed some of her fantasies to me and based on that, I think she would be open to trying this stuff. But I'm afraid that if she's not she'll think negatively of me for wanting to do these things. 
 Up to this point it's been easier to just push aside my fantasies because the fear of her not being accepting scares me too much. Which is honestly just my hang-up because I don't think she would react negatively.

My aunt told me my father was a ""no good nigger"" and I was very lucky to be half-white. 
 When my Mom died, they all came shambling into the funeral and wake. I kept a mask on, I didn't want to make a scene. After the burial, I got in my car, drove off, and haven't spoken to any of them since. 
 Don't look back, don't hold a grudge, you got away from them and their toxic bullshit. I laugh at it now, they're so silly and sad in their craziness and I have a wonderful bunch of friends (who are more family to me than they could ever be) and I'm happy.

 Sorry for the rant, it's just working in reality TV, I run into multiclip situations all the time, and it seems like the least functioning thing in all of Avid. It REALLY drives me nuts when I just need to link master audio to a single video clip (grouped clip) and once I sync it I have to build them one by one, something that a keyboard shortcut does without any extra menus in FCP and CC. 
 And if anyone has any solutions to any of the above, by all means share. I'm glad this was posted, its one of those things I have to do all the time and kept thinking, ""God, I have GOT to be doing this the wrong way, this is stupid"", but this post has re-affirmed it's the safest and surefire method of accomplishing that grueling task.

"this happened about 2 hours ago. It all started about 2 days ago. 
 I messaged both ""Alice"", and ""Stacy"" this Sunday, on OKCupid. I am a sad lonely man, and I need a ladyfriend. They both happened to respond. Awesome! 
 I set up the date with ""Stacy"" first. We set it for this Friday, around 415 for coffee. Cool. 
 Now, if any of you have ever dated online before, you know how often flakes, cancels, fades, and general bullshit happens. 
 So as I was still talking to Stacy, I set up a date with Alice. Based on my talking with Stacy, she seemed somewhat reserved and timid, and it felt like a ""1-2 hour"" coffee date kind of thing. So I figured I had time on Friday night to go out with Alice. 
 Alice and I play some rocket league, set up a date Friday night, everything is groovy. 
 Fast forward to today. I talked to both Stacyand Alice on/off until today. About 3 hours ago, I receive this message from Stacyon OKCupid: 
 ""Oh my god this is too funny. You should che-"" 
 At this point, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Then I got a text from Alice...

 We grow up, going through school, learning to be good people and not to make the mistakes our ancestors did. Learning to work. 
 We're all grown up. We've moved out. We work. For the rest of our lives we work and save money. Have kids. Raise them, like we were raised, just with new technology. 
 We're old. Not dying yet. What do we do? Spend the money we spent our whole lives saving. 
 Throughout this pointless adventure, you've seen people die, be born, grow up, go bankrupt, win the lottery. You've seen death, happiness, sadness, depression, anger, all these things.

"Condor/Reapers/Silver, with an Asari vanguard, Krogan vanguard and Geth Infiltrator. I was running my Salaraian Engineer, which I was working to level up for the weekend. By round 10, banshees are everywhere, but no one is taking them down with missiles. Which I can understand. If you gold frequently, you gotta save them for that sort of deal and in silver, using a Cobra on any round by 10 or extraction is admitting defeat but can be necessary. 
 However, these fucking people refused to use them when it would've been completely justifiable. At one point, 2 brutes and 2 banshees were stuck on each other, and I could only see them over a ridge and thus was not going to get a clear shot. Long story short: its down to me and the Asari, and she seems to think biotic charges are going to kill banshees. No, they aren't. I then play medic to her until she gets insta-killed by a brute and proceed to attempt to play Rambo, soloing round 10 with a class not really suited to reapers. I tried my best: used all my rockets, med packs and revives. But, I got stuck on a piece of cover and banshee killed. 
 So I can appreciate the need to save Cobra missiles. I do. But if there are 2 banshees stacked on top of each other, and you and I are the only people alive and I'm across the map, fucking use one. Don't die and make me run across the map to fire one, have the game glitch so it kills nothing, and then have me revive you so that you can proceed to continue to do nothing.

"Second grade teacher.
Accidentally skipped one worksheet I was suppose to do in the 'circle of work' she made and when she found out, chewed me out about it and made me work on it during show and tell.
When my name gets called she said
""Actually, (Censordoll) won't be doing a show and tell today. In fact she will be spending her lunch in detention.""
Cue entire class gasping.
I just remembered panicking about it not because I never got detention but because I NEVER KNEW WHAT THE FUCK IT WAS OR WHERE IT WAS.
She didn't write anything down or give me anything or tell me where it was.
So lunch happens and I'm waiting in line and see a bunch of trouble making kids give this teacher aid a piece of paper and they go ahead to get their lunch. 
I just think 'well shit I never got that so I'm just gonna act like I never got detention'. The look on everyone's face at lunch when they saw me eating with them was priceless, they were all just surprised and confused that I was there.
Teacher never said anything and after that year was over mum moved us to a different school after I told her what happened. 
 Oh also I think she just hated me because one time she fuckin knew that me and my best friend were dressed to be partners in the play as we were dressed exactly the same and she deliberately decides to, on the day of the play, have the partners be alphabetical after she had told us previously that we could pick our partners.

 LISTEN: 
 What do you think happens when people keep repeating  flawed technique , day after day, for hours on end? They just get better at playing BADLY! Sure, in many cases, as someone repeats something their subconscious picks up on the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of what they are doing, and corrects them, but much more often this kind of advice causes people to just grind away without paying attention to what they are doing until they hit THE PLATEAU- that horrible frustrating plain from which it becomes impossible to rise off. I hit it myself years ago: I wanted to improve my picking accuracy and speed, so every day, for a couple of hours a day, for  years  I would grind away at the same fucking major scale pattern and never got any better. It wasn't until I realised that I wasn't really aware of  why  I was having so much trouble, and started to really focus consciously on specific elements of my technique, that I began to actually improve. 
 I feel really strongly that for this reason it should be against the reddiquette of this sub to smugly say shit like ""Just practise man. Practice practice practice. That's how I got so awesome lol!"" Every bastard  knows  they have to practice, and people who come here are generally looking for  slightly  more specific guidance than that.

The topic I'd like to take up here is fairly repetitive and you're gunna disregard it.So go ahead, roll your eyes like a sexy chick and get your guns loaded.Shall help us move in the right direction.To me this is something (not so) really, seemingly dumb but kinda makes sense..Specially to a  certain  type of the population. 
 Enter a fat beginner (Me).Shuffed down, shut down, depressed, suppressed and full of why-so-fat resentment.Discovers amazing transformations on the internet and learns bout leangains. Zero experience under the bar, takes Martin Berkhan's lifting philosophy, eats at a deficit, does RPT like fucking 31 minutes would do it : no SS bullshit, because why not, (btw, 31 minutes' workout is legit.I approve of it's awesomeness and that I found the exact same template in a shady document.In the pdf version, only cable crunches are excluded on legs day,just so you know) and loses a lotta weight (Think bout 5 months of cutting,loses over 15 kilos). Now now.. Most cut/bulk advocates would insist on doing the same..""Cut till you see your abs, then slooooooooooooooooooowwww bulk,boy."" 
 Back to reality.My goal weight is 67.5 kg, weighed myself in the morning and was blown away. It read 68.8 kg. Brb. Need to slip into a fantastical coma... 
 Back.Ok. So. I've read up Lyle Mcdonalds' website. I've read forums where he critiqued Martin Berkhan's bulks.A dude was kind enough to compile it into a pdf.The",1610,"of which would be ""Half of your gains were muscle, half fat.The best recomp is +20/-20 while at 16/8 fasting scheme"". That essentially presents to us a fact,in fact conclusively, most gains from a traditional bulk would result in a 1:1 muscle:fat format.  That's a clean slow bulk mind you. One. 
 Two, 31 minutes' DEXA scan results show us that he got something close to 1:1 format gains while eating at a 1750 weekly surplus. Again, Slow clean(est) bulk. 
 Since I'm near my goal weight, don't really have the kinda muscle framework I'd dig, but I'm the leanest I've ever been nonetheless: I think ex fatty novices once near their goal weight could benefit from a recomp thereafter. Everything's so perfect,you got newb gains in the bag..You've leaned out a fair bit, have got past the 'novice' standards on the lifts.. What gives? (Even Jason Jason Blaha propagates it) 
 Lastly it'd be injustice to these two super cool dudes since we're on the same topic..THEY MADE IT. The two recomp progress posts still give me chills in the spine.They're fucking amazing.Thank you guys! 
 As an aside,I think I might just pull a lil something like that off.. Using a recomp once I hit my goal weight. 
 Temme what you think guys.I'm all up for learning.And enjoy your weekend.

By all measures, I have completely fallen apart this winter: I've skipped work for over a week (everyone has noticed), I'm failing as a student (everyone is taking notice), I'm failing as an adult (my bank has taken notice), and I'm starting to fail as a person (my family is starting to notice). Somehow I can't bring myself to give a fuck. 
 The best thing that happened to me recently is coming down with a pretty bad cold+infection. It forced me to go to the doctor and she could tell just from chatting with me that something wasn't right (classic INT* failing at small talk). She almost dragged me to the counseling center herself because she (rightfully) assumed that I would never go on my own. And so I had my first appointment with a therapist. 
 It was... therapeutic. 
 I spent a good 90 minutes rambling about my life, my failures, my petty problems. I got diagnosed with depression or seasonal-affective or something, but at that point I didn't really care. The experience was a bit awkward, but very liberating, and in the three days since, I've been doing better and slowly pulling my shit together again (bills paid, apartment cleaned, projects submitted, and amends somewhat made). It's  possible  probable that I would have gotten my drive back naturally within a few weeks anyway because I tend to have seasonal slumps that I always manage to pull through, but I think therapy helped.",1611,swallow your pride and see a therapist.,39,0.6729170083999634,0.1108127534389495,0.0063769593834877,0.0001616108056623,0.6110115647315979,0.0010757636046037,0.0017820098437368,0.0005877233343198,0.0359019972383976,0.0035808077082037,0.0020232275128364,0.0008351503056474,"By all measures, I have completely fallen apart this winter.

"Go through his history.  He constantly bitches about digg, even when there's absolutely no context for it.  I've run into him a number of times already.  He never adds anything worthwhile to conversation. 
 Listen, I spent years on digg and the shit that people accuse the digg crowd of was simply not a rampant problem there to start with.  I would say that without question, the biggest assholes there were the people who came from reddit just to start shit.  People like kuzb.  I did a lot of lurking on reddit but kept my commenting on digg, mainly because I didn't have time for two sites that served the same purpose.  The traffic here has definitely increased but it was already trending upward well before digg imploded.  There were certainly a number of people that switched allegiances when that happened but I can definitely say there's been a trend of apparently younger and younger people joining up lately.  Or at least less and less mature.  I see no reason to believe that had anything to do with digg though.  I think it's more likely a symptom of reddit becoming more widely known and attracting a broader swath of the idiotic public. 
 If you're so hung up on needing a small and elitist version of reddit, take the fucking open source code and start your own version.  Lock it down so you can control the people who are allowed to join.  That is very much not the model that reddit works on though.

"I've never used this platform for buying PC games before, but what the hell, google told me they have a good price for Dark Souls 3 so I decided to try them out. 
 Big fucking mistake. 
 First off the website is absolutely dreadful. Clicking on buttons and trying to navigate anywhere takes ages, and adding or removing things from your cart is more or less luck of the draw, and it won't really work 95% of the time you try to do something. 
 If you actually get to the checkout process, good luck to you because you're gonna need it. The website crashes pretty often and the cart balance changes every now and then because the website has decided I want 4 dark souls copies instead of 1. Seems legit, but it also doesn't show you this change in price until the ""checkout"", so if you're not paying attention, you can get fucked by this shitty ass website, and end up spending more than you are comfortable with for no good reason. 
 Also it's very nice that although the cart balance varies wildly from page to page on the website, when you mouseover the cart button, it actually tells you that your cart is empty and won't show you the products inside. Nice. 
 I spent longer than I'd like to work trying to get this shit to work, since I really wanted Dark Souls 3 but this website was one of the most frustrating things I've had to deal with in a long time. At the end of the day I sucked it up, paid more money and decided to go with another retailer such as steam or g2a.

Do you want to support transfer of knowledge, which will slowly render your STEM-degree obsolete, unless you are willing to relocate to some Chinese metropolis? 
 I bet 99.99% of people writing bullshit like this are still owners of a television. How do they even dare trying to tell me which movies to watch, just because some female role has a strong part in it?

 I've seen this happen in car once. Some poor girl inadvertently cuts off a guy in a 70s Bug and the fucking maniac in the bug tries for 5 straight, relatively dense freeway miles to literally run her off the road. If she hadn't taken serious evasive action, she'd likely have crashed at around 50mph in traffic. CA license plates are white with blue lettering. The guy in the bug had sanded off the blue lettering so that the numbers were whitish and impossible to read from any distance. I was on the phone with the police describing the event and following (at a distance, in a car) as the two of them tore in and out of traffic in case something happened, but could never get the plate numbers to the cops. In the end, he abruptly veers across the freeway to take a quick exit and for all I know, the fuckwit does this shit daily. I pulled up to the girl to try to express some sort of sympathy but she was fixed facing forward, crying pretty damn heavily.

 I ordered ~$400 worth of shit around black friday and after waiting the expected ~3 weeks I get a tiny package with ~$80 worth of shit I didn't order.  We all know how impossibru it is to get ahold of customer service.  They don't respond to email, and you wait for 30+ min on hold and never get to speak to anyone.

"Go to a bank immediately, or go online (Chase Bank is one I'm thinking of) and open a new checking account with $50. 
 Take almost all of the money out of the existing account, and make sure the account has no overdraft protection.  You will need to request that the overdraft protection be removed.  Go to the bank to do this.  Don't write a check that will take several days to clear.  Get cash, or a cashier's check, as your withdrawal.  Make doubly and triply sure that the overdraft protection has been removed. 
 The money you took out, put it the new checking account.  Explain the situation to them, make sure that the only withdrawals that are allowed are ones that use checks with the appropriate signature or debit card.  No EFT.  Having a local bank for this new account, where you can walk in to talk to a person, is handy.  But a bank online will do in a pinch. 
 Now, when the asshole bank tries to EFT the funds, there won't be enough there, and their EFT request will bounce.  If your bank tries to charge you some fee for the bounce, tell them that you never authorized any such EFT, and they can talk to the asshole bank. 
 Of course, if your bank and asshole bank are the same bank, they'll balk at that, but fuck them. 
 Now you have a little breathing room.  Your grandmother's money is safe.  Next, figure out what things are being direct deposited into that account (social security, disability, any wages, whatever).  Change those direct deposits to go into the new account you opened.

"Edit2: Okay, so it seems like you guys think that I'm pissed that this guy told me to fuck off. That is not the case. I understand the whole freedom of speech thing and agree that he had every right to tell me to fuck off. But that's not what I'm asking you guys. I'm asking if the person from the linked thread was right to wear the offensive shirt he did. Btw, I edited my post to hopefully get my point across better. 
 Hey Reddit. I want to propose a question for those of you in the Atheism subreddit. Today, as I'm sure most of you have, I came upon this link: It was the shirt a guy wore to a church that his friend convinced him to go to for 1 day. My question to you is - Am I the only person who finds an issue with this person's actions? The thread was filled with comments of people supporting this. Don't get me wrong, I am atheist myself, bordering on being anti-theist. And I found this picture hilarious. But I also found the person's actions to be pretty fucking immature and rather distasteful. When I protested, I was told to fuck off. The reason being? Because the moderate christians are the ones who allow the extremists to continue to exist in this country. 
 Not only do I feel like we, as non-believers, do not have to stoop to the level of those who condemn others who do not share their beliefs, I feel like actions such as the person who wore the offensive shirt are more detrimental towards trying to help people become more skeptical about religion and other irrational beliefs. 
 Or am I just being too sensitive? Thanks for reading.

 You can't make an argument in a political forum and then follow up with 'anyone who disagrees is a child rapist' that's not how debate works, that's not how democracy works, and thats not how we come to fair and proper decisions or laws.

"The first time I did shrooms was the biggest buzz kill I have had in my entire life. So I am with this chick, her little sister, and two of our friends. We get the shrooms for a pretty good price, and we go to a chill pavillion next to the pool. I ate around 2.5, and i got a really nice visual effect that basically looked like I was looking through a tye dye shirt that was constantly changing. On top of that I was feeling very giggly and had a nice body high. We walked around to the parking lot, and my friend takes off his shoes and starts walking around. The next thing I know, my friends little sister cuts her foot on glass. So we walk over to my house, and I start peaking. I don't want to do shit except walk around and feel fucking fantastic. I wasn't paying much attention to anything, so the chicks older sister starts yelling at me to go inside and get something to help with her foot. I meander inside and cannot find shit. I couldn't even find paper towels. There simply wasn't anything there. So she yells at me some more, all three of the chicks are freaking the fuck out, and being crazy women. They finally leave to go help her, so I go inside to chill out. Five minutes later my mom walks into the house, and starts flipping out because I tracked mud in all over her new carpet. And when my mom flips, she brings up every irrelevant thing you could think of. After my botched attempt to clean the carpet high as fuck, I just give up.

"At some point in this journey of yours, you're going to come close to caving. Maybe you will cave. In fact, it's likely that you will. But assuming you don't, it's almost certain that you will get close. You'll somehow convince yourself that it's not a big deal, and doing it just once couldn't be too bad. Why are you even doing this anyway? You're missing out! You're torturing yourself. You've had a boner for days. Your mood has been a pendulum swinging between anger and depression. 
 You have to realize that all of these justifications you create are signs of weakness. Dropping your pants  just this once  won't seem like a big deal now, but in hindsight, you'll hate yourself. You'll be back at square one. Anyone who's caved can attest to that. There's a motto you have to remember at all times. It truly applies to everything you do ever, but it's especially helpful for challenges like these. It goes something like this: 
 No fucking excuses. 
 Did you set a goal? Maybe it was 30 days. If that's the case, you go for 30 goddamn days. If day 15 rolls around, and you just can't bear it anymore, you don't say ""15 days is a long time, probably more than most people could go. I'll reward myself."" That's a huge step backwards. It's your addiction clinging to you. It's clouding your judgement. You're making excuses. Remember the motto?  No fucking excuses. 
 It's like climbing a hill. At the beginning of your challenge, you started at the bottom. It's going to be tiring, and you'll want to stop. If you let yourself slip, you roll all the way to the bottom of the hill. Now you're tired AND at the bottom of the hill. Was that really worth it?",1659,"NO FUCKING EXCUSES.

"Ha! I've almost done this and I'm proud to tell this story. 
 I lived in a ground floor apartment with no air conditioning, except a window mounted machine that was 20 years old and barely managed to keep my bedroom/living room cold. 
 I used to walk around in boxer and a t-shirt because it was on the ground floor and I worried about people seeing inside, even through the slits on my blinds. 
 So one very hot day I decided to cook a chicken breast in the oven. It was an older oven, and the glass panel on the front always got dangerously hot. 
 So after 40 mins of the chicken cooking, I pull out the tray and place it on top of the stove.  I close the oven door, and start to make my dinner. 
 I reached up into the cupboards above my stove, to grab some seasoning when I felt something really weird.  I froze, while my brain tried to register what I was feeling.  Suddenly I realized that as I had leaned up to get the seasoning, I had leaned against the front of the oven.  My penis had slipped out of my boxers, through the front flap, and my body proceeded to squish it against the hot glass. 
 Something that hot pressing up against your penis isn't something that should ever happen, and I don't know why I didn't realize it.  I just remember thinking ""this feels weird..."" And freezing for a few seconds. 
 I grabbed the spatula and tried to pry my penis off the glass as the skin had now melted itself to it. 
 Fuck no, I'm just kidding. After a few seconds I pulled away and ended up putting an ice pack on my cock for a bit. Wasn't a bad burn at all, would probably be like touching a very, very hot car hood in the sun.  Just with your penis.",1659,"sandwiched my penis between myself and the oven glass.

"As the title states, I'm still pretty new to the whole sex thing. I used to not be bothered by the fact that my penis wasn't as big as even the average, but now that I'm in college and that I'm starting to consider asking girls/having a relationship, I'm starting to actually be more worried/embarrassed about it. 
 As you probably know, 'small dick jokes' are pretty common on campuses filled with freshmen, and I don't know how red my asian face gets whenever I have to hear one from a girl that I'm super attracted to. 
Me being a nerdy and slightly chubby asian guy doesn't help my confidence factor around women, either. 
 And, for the most part, I had a sheltered childhood in which I was never formally taught about sex, nor have I ever had a girlfriend in the past, so my only resources on it was the internet, and you also know how mean people can be on it. 
 So yeah...I need some advice on how to overcome this insecurity and embarrassing feeling.
Like, what do I do if I actually get to that point with a girl and she's not so happy about what I (don't) have? Or what if she laughs and leaves and tells pretty much every other girl on campus that I've got...yeah. 
 Does size matter to these girls? 
Is there anything I can do to make a girl feel that I'm worthwhile(sexually)?
What do I do/how am I supposed to react if she takes it coldly and pulls a worst-case-scenario(see above) on me? 
 For clarification I'm not worried about it in the sense that I don't measure up to other guys -- I'm pretty okay and confident in that regard because I don't care. I'm worried that girls I meet will be like what I see online. (eg: HAHA TOO SMALL, GO FUCK A MIDGET)",1669,"college kid worried about his junk
And for those of you who are skeptical, and think I'm under-sizing myself from my point of view, here's a picture for comparison.

"I'm a 25 year old male, I reside in Northern Illinois (DeKalb County), and there are multiple things on my body that need examining. This wouldn't be a problem, ya know, if I had insurance and didn't make minimum wage, but alas, here I am, a minimum wage uninsured guy that has some serious worries. 
  For starters, I am pretty sure I have either a VERY bad hernia, or something is wrong with my prostate. I piss every hour and almost cant make it to the bathroom. And when I pee, its for 5 glorious seconds. I remember peeing much much longer and way less often. I kinda need this. I mean, whats the point of living without a  (working) dick?

 Now my teeth. They are falling apart…on the reals, breaking and chipping. (I take care of them, damnit!). I don't know what the fuck is going on. Maybe wisdom teeth? It isn't fun, the back of my mouth pounds with every heartbeat, from the moment wake up at 5 am, to the moment I finally get to sleep at 12 am. 

 Next, the back. I have no lower backpain at all, it all sits in between and right below my shoulders (mid back) and kinda on the spine. Crippling pain, to when I lay down on my back it feels like i'm being stabbed in the spine and sometimes have to gasp to get air because it hurts too much to flex my diaphragm and get a breath, so I hold it off until my body makes me breathe. It also hurts too much to even do simple stretches to try and kill the problem. This is a problem for everyday life, for I'm doomed to work in a fucking factory right now :(

"Well this happened New Years eve/ day but just became a fuck up as of yesterday. 
 So my girlfriend and I shared a hotel room with another couple were close with on New Years eve. We went to a local party, consumed mucho alcohol at said party then took an uber back to the hotel. Now my buddy got a suite and thus it had a separate living room area with a pull out couch. There was a door that separated the living room from the bed room where my buddy and his girlfriend were sleeping. Well this is where the problem begins. We stumble back into the hotel room and all of us go to our respective rooms. Well it's about 3 or 4am and I wake up and I gotta piss bad. My girlfriend is out, listen quietly and I hear my buddy and his girlfriend have some intimate relations in their room...their room where the bathroom is. I wait a while but I still hear them up and not wanting to interrupt their good time I went to the corner of the room, took a piss in a bottle, hid it in my bag and went back to sleep. Next day we wake up check out and head on about our lives. 
 Fast forward to yesterday, I was lazy and never unpacked the overnight bag from New Years. My girlfriend decides she's tired of looking at this damn bag so she goes to throw all the clothes into the laundry and put the bag away. I'm at work and I get a text from her ""why the fuck is there a bottle of pee in your overnight bag?!"" I totally forgot about the bottle.

"Messed up the title FOOT scraper not FOOD . 
 Reddit I fucked up. 
 It all happened about a week ago,  I returned home after a night out and was still extremely drunk. 
 I walk to the bathroom and prepare myself to go to bed.  Suddenly in the corner of my eye I see something I have never  seen ( [this bastard!] ( 
 Drunk me inspects the object and comes to the conclusion that this must be used for scraping dead skin of your forehead. 
I scrape my forehead and drunk me is pleased with the result, I go upstairs and fall asleep instantly. 
 A few hours later I wake up cause my stomach is hurting like a bitch. I go to the toilet do my business,  and as I leave I give myself a look in the mirror. 
 I freak the fuck out I have scratches everywhere on my forehead. I have no idea how they got there cause I have a bad habit of getting blackouts/brownouts. 
 I quickly realize the best course of action is to disinfect the wounds. I grab my aftershave and pour some of it in my hand and rub it over my head . 
 I SCREAMED. 
My face was burning, it is the most painful thing ever to happen to me. 
 I try to figure out what happened to my face.  I go through my photo album on my phone.  There are pictures from right before I left the party witch show my forehead smooth as fuck.

"Mate sorry, but you're in a pickle. Right now you see this as the major problem in your relationship and so does she. For completely different reasons. 
 I've been in a similar situation, where she began to think that all I wanted was sex and associated any form of affection as me trying to get in her pants. You need to help her change her mind on this. You do this through your actions. I'd be willing to bet every time you do this she is thinking ""Here he goes again. I wish he would stop trying to pressure me. He knows how I'm trying to get over this."" This would only reinforce her behaviour and make that sexual lust gap even bigger. 
 I'd suggest stop telling her your fantasies, or about any sexual thoughts. Stop trying to feel her up or make things sexual when you're alone. The fact that you're both so nervous about sex makes the pressure even more. 
 Most IMPORTANTLY tell her you're going to do this, because you feel you're pressuring her and want her to do things when she's comfortable and not just to please you. Otherwise she will be confused about the sudden stop of constant sexual affection and start to worry you're getting it elsewhere. 
 But follow through with this and help her change her mind about sex, then shit might just get really good in the bedroom. But if you don't, you're gonna have a woman who hates sex and will never do anything apart from the traditional vanilla moves. Plus you'll fuck her up for at least ten years so any other guys who date her will have it even harder than you.

"By fucking a ""taken"" woman, you unmask her as an unworthy recipient of male commitment. Not only are you giving the cuckolded boyfriend/husband a chance to confront his poor partner choice/relationship management, you are giving yourself the experience necessary for identifying your own Unicorn from amongst the ponies in party hats. 
 > Your sources are fucking ridiculous. How are you endorsed? 
 Because we endorse this kind of behavior. 
 > Simply put, the reason why the Puerarchy in all of its riotous Girls Gone Wild glory is so valuable to the Patriarchy 2.0 is because it acts as a screening mechanism for the near-mythical Woman of Quality. The future Outstanding Husbands and Word’s Best Dads look remarkably similar to the future Chronic Alcoholics and Unrepentant Gamers when in their larval forms. Women who have a consistently difficult time detecting between the two are generally poor marriage prospects. By pumping and dumping every woman you can during your Puerarchy you help detect and reveal character issues and other traits of a future ex-wife long before you are inexorably entwined in her DNA. 
 > That sounds crude and nasty to a lot of women . . . I hope. That’s the point. The worse the behavior of the Puerarchy, the quicker and clearer the reveal. And by mastering good Puerarch behavior, a future Wolf Alpha family man – the current gold standard of the SMP – can successfully hide among his Puerach brethren until such time as he should reveal himself to a Woman of Quality.

"I feel like my social anxiety is my only vice right now, my only weakness. Fuck it is a powerful one though and I hate it! I'm out tonight, with friends, and I just couldn't.. do.. anything. 
 I was just stuck, they're buying me drinks, pretty girls asking me to dance and trying hard to get me moving but I just stand there with my arms folded feeling like shit. I just can't fucking move and I hate being pitied. I just gave up and said fuck it I want to go home I'm no good at this, I can't do it, I'm letting people down, I'm bringing people down, people don't want to be around me, I'm not fun, I'm not engaging. 
 The entire night girls are checking me out but even when drunk I can't make eye contact with them. They say girls like confidence. Confidence isn't my problem, I have a psychological disorder that is paralysing me. I enjoy a challenge and invite it in many circumstances, but this is the one area where I just shrivel up and want to disappear. 
 I feel sick and overwhelmed when people pay attention to me, I just feel like I'm on a different level. They're normal people who can socialize, and I'm just way the fuck down here; they're expecting me to dance when I can barely stand without feeling uncomfortable. 
 In many ways I want to be dead. It just feels like such a big hurdle, especially seeing as every time I go out I come home being even more neurotic because nothing goes my way. I will be this way forever and I don't want to live like that. My last chance is to become a black belt in Aikido; they say once I achieve that then everything else will follow.

"Night before last I blew up my d boys phone to no avail. Yesterday about noon he texts me saying he's in Portland to stock up. Usually when he goes up there he brings back some Fuckin FIRE. so I get all excited thinking he'd probly be back in town around 6-7 or so. We live on the complete opposite end of Oregon, about a 25 minute drive to the California border. 
 Call him a little after 8 pm. He picks up and tells me hes still there, but should be back home around 2. I'm like ""fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Alright gimme a call when you're back."" Smoked a fair amount of meth the past couple days so I knew I'd be up. 4 am he texts me that he's back. I ask if he can deliver cause it's like 15 degrees outside and he says no. So I put on a sweater, and a hoodie, and a jacket, some gloves and a beanie. Hop on my longboard and cruise all the way across town. Our city ain't too big, but it's big enough to make this suck. 
 Takes me a little over a half hour to get there and the dude can't find his scale. Finally he finds it and gives me my shit plus a little extra for coming to him. Fuckin a buddy! I ask if he cared if I smoke a little bit before I bail and he shuts me down cause he's got a bunch of other clients stopping by.

"I never saw the original SW movies as a child, but every time I mentioned this fact to anyone, the reaction was generally along the lines of ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SW WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU HAVE TO WATCH THESE MOVIES IMMEDIATELY!"" So, understandably, I had pretty fucking high expectations when I finally watched them a few months ago, and they did not even come close to living up to the expectations people had set for me. 
 The writing was mediocre, the acting was only slightly better, the action was dull, there were so many little plot holes and logical inconsistencies throughout the movies, not to mention the fucking star-wipes like this is some kind of power-point presentation for my high school English class. 
 I went into these movies with high expectations and no nostalgia-tinted goggles, and I'm pretty upset that for 20 years of my life, not a single fucking person was honest with me about these movies. I'm not saying they're bad, despite my criticisms in the previous paragraph, they're certainly good movies. But I would have enjoyed them a hell of a lot more if people had just said ""They're good movies."" rather than ""HOLY SHIT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU HAVE TO SEE THESE MOVIES!"" And when I brought these things up to my many friends who have verbally assaulted me for not having seen these movies earlier, they told me I was crazy. 
 Am I crazy? Am I alone in this opinion? Is there anybody willing to give an honest review of these movies?

"This really sucks.  Unfortunately, I can totally see how something like this can happen.  There is so much paperwork and bullshit you have to get through to get some of these meds covered.  Not just with state insurance, commercial insurance is WORSE sometimes.  Anybody that thinks our healthcare system is fine the way it is, work a few days at a job where you bill for various services and you will see how WRONG you are. 
 I'm a pharmacist, so I deal with issues like this almost daily.  I will say that the state programs tend to have worse support lines.  Calling them is like a nightmare.  It blows my mind how stupid and uncaring some of those people are. 
 Speaking as a healthcare provider, I definitely would have at least provided the kid with an albuterol inhaler at no charge.  But, Walgreens is such a different environment than where I work at.  My main focus is patient care, profits come second.  Walgreens is all about profits, overworking their employees, etc.  I doubt the pharmacist even had time to realize the severity of the situation.  Walgreens is bad for pharmacy and our healthcare system. 
 Seriously, where I work, I would have sat down with the mom.  I could have advised her on what to do and would have noticed how serious things were getting.  I would have worked until it was figured out because as pharmacists, our role is to ensure patient health.  We take an oath.

"I just need to tell someone and I dont want to tell anyone that knows him or us because I just can't. 
 Anyway we've been together four years this Dec. We live together have a dog and cat basically married w/o kids. Like so many of you guys sex was great sometimes twice in a night! Then started getting slower which was fine im happy at a few times a week.  Then we move in together... down to one a weekend because I worked first and he worked second shift only really saw each other on the weekend that was fine. Then we both start working the same hours even less sex now! How did that even work?! He blames stress okay I get it and its slowly less and less sex. We are now to one every 4-6 weeks and only if I initiate and even then he turns me down I'll go to give him a bj he pushes me away saying I'm ""suffocating"" him I'm to ""clingy"". (I'm very independent but highly sexual oh also in the time we've been together he has never gotten me off or even cared if I did reach orgasm) 
 I started getting suspicious do I look through his history and what do you know he's still looking at porn, I wouldn't care of he was still having sex with me but he's not. Well I'm officially breaking it off find out yesterday he posted to craigslist while I was at work asking for a ""casual encounter because he needs to experience life"" I have asked him multiple times if we could open the relationship so that I could be satisfied and not start resenting him I've told him multiple times I would be open to a threesome. Obviously that didn't matter he would rather go behind my back and send strangers naked pictures of himself so that he can get off them thinking about my feelings or wants. Fuck that shit.

"New York City. Arrive as excited 20 yr old Brit. Been saving up for 2 years for this week in the States. Just me. 
 Unfortunately I arrive the day after Gordon Brown released al Megrahi, so anti-UK feeling is quite high. 
 Unfortunately, I used to be Prince William's doppelganger. 
 I arrive at youth hostel with what I thought would be enough cash. I didn't know that in the States tax isn't included in advertised price. Have to wander the streets of NYC to look for a payphone to ask my friend to wire me some cash. Couldn't figure out how to ring England, so call operator. When talking to operator three people come up behind me, shove my head into the phone booth and go 'fuck off back to England Prince William. You're all American killing fags'. I turn around to fetch them the old heave-ho when one hits me in the stomach and steals my roll of quarters. That was nice. 
 Eventually get friend, they wire me money, I go to ATM and draw out last of the money on my tourist card, as I know that the friend's cash would be arriving the next day. Stand under scaffolding kneeling down and counting out dollars to make sure that the $400 I needed was there. Two cops pull over and ask me what I'm doing, and accuse me of being a drug dealer. They search through all my stuff to make sure there are no drugs, and just leave my things on the street an call me a jerk for counting money on a street corner. Also tell me Gordon Brown is a jerk. Leave. 
 Get back to youth hostel. Give them money for room. They take money, then tell me that I'm lucky the manager isn't in cos she hates Brits and if I'd left for 45 mins while she was there I would have lost my room. 
 Go to bed.

"No, it is not ""normal"" for straight people to ""struggle"" with same-sex attractions. That is something that closeted non-straight people do. 
 I think it might be a good idea to see if you can talk to him about what he's going through. If nothing else, you can be supportive of him, right? And if he's a friend, that's worthwhile. Maybe a  small  quantity of alcohol, as a social lubricant, could help you both ease up a little bit to talk about things easier? (Note: I am not encouraging you to get him drunk and take advantage of him, or even to get him drunk to get him to spill what his deal is!) 
 As far as NOT EVEN LIKING MEN, well... okay, here's the thing. I think, and I feel like a lot of people think, sexuality is more of a continuum than a digital system of fully heterosexual/fully homosexual/bisexual/pansexual/asexual. If there was a scale of 0-100 for how much you were sexually attracted to women, I'm guessing you'd be at, I don't know, a 92, yeah? And if there was a scale of how much you were attracted to men... well, maybe it would be a 5 or a 10. Which is to say, a non-zero number: that for most people, there is at least a small extent to which they have the potential to be attracted to members of either sex. 
 And it sounds like you're attracted to this guy, maybe, so if you have the opportunity to explore it - I say, go with it! I wouldn't just blurt out ""Hey, you're really hot, do you want to fuck?"", or something, definitely be  careful  with the situation, because as you say there's a high degree of risk. 
 As far as your ""friends""? Anyone who doesn't respect you and love you for who you are is not a real friend. If it comes down to it, and they can't handle that, fuck 'em - they are not worth your time.

"Met a girl online, lives two hours away. We video chat twice and she seems pretty enough. We arrange to meet the next day at 6:00pm. I leave work early the next day and drive two hours across the state. I park in front of her house, give her a call, she walks out and gets in my car. A bit taller, chubbier and uglier than I expected. We go to the park and do some small talk. I cop a feel here and there it gets really dark really soon, we head for the car and I begin fingering her. She tells me she's a virgin bullshit I say. I get on top of her and start doing some humping. A car parks next to us and we sit still and hide. The car stays there for a while and an old couple walks out and leaves for a night walk. We decide to pick a different location. We drive around town for about an hour before parking the car on this really dark residential st. She insists on us going to the back of my car I agree.

"As a woman, I am going to give you some advice here. You're not going to like hearing it but I am going to say it anyway. 
 The thing we ladies don't seem to understand about men and sex is that sex is a LOT of fucking pressure on a guy. He spends (if he is a considerate lover) the majority of the time trying NOT to blow his load and make sure you are having a good time. 
 It can be extremely anxiety inducing. Will he blow too soon, is him holding backing making him go soft and making her think he isn't into her. Did she get off, did he do enough foreplay? Not to mention guys do most of the work when it comes to thrusting. Very rarely does a guy just get to sit back and just feel good and cum.. this is where masturbation comes in. A guy gets to focus just on himself and relieve some stress. And since men are visual while women are mental, he uses porn to help facilitate this. It has nothing to do with you and you making it about you is kind of selfish. 
 You say you are ready to go at any time right? Well does that mean that you are willing to just be a wet hole for him to get off into with no foreplay if he is just tired and wants some release?? I am suspecting no. You will want foreplay and seduction and to get off right? And its his job to do that for you right? 
 Also, I always ask this of fellow females, do you have any ""romance novels""? Read 50 shades of grey? Guess what, you consumed porn. And please don't say you were riveted by the plot, that's like saying people go to hooters for the wings.. 
 So to end this novel, stop being selfish, show some empathy and understand that when a man is getting off to an image it isn't about you. It doesn't mean he doesn't want you, it means he just wants to blow his load as soon as he can.",1762,"Sex puts a lot of performance pressure on a guy so sometimes a dude just needs to nut.

"Sorry for wall of text, I typed this on my IPod. Though this happened around three weeks ago, I'll believe this is probably one of my dumbest fuck ups I had ever made. There were only a few days left of my strength training class before first semester ended so my teacher had decided to have the class play a game of kickball rather than lifting. In this game of kickball there were only two bases: home and the wall on the opposite side of the gym. To score all you had to do was kick the ball and run from home to second base (the opposite wall), and back and not get hit with the ball. Pretty simple and easy right? The game was going fine, my team was in the lead and it was finally my turn to kick again. My previous kick had caused the team to get an out so I felt that couldn't screw up this time. I kick the ball and I run at a full sprint towards second base. I was going FAST, no one was gonna get me out. Finally I'm approaching the wall (second base) and I think of the greatest idea at the time. To stop my fast ass I'll just stick my foot in front of me and pivot off the wall and run back to home. Full speed ahead! I stick my foot infront of me and hit the wall. CRACK!!! The everyone goes silent as the loud snap of the bone in my leg echoes through the gym. There I lay in shame on the cold hard floor screaming all kinds of curses. My class surrounds me as I flail around in pain till my African-American friend, who I presumed told everyone to move out the way to help me up, looks me dead in the eye and says, ""You're stupid.""

"This is a little guide on how to convert a peasant, in case the title was too much for you. 
 The first thing to understand is that THIS IS NOT A FUCKING E-PEEN CATFIGHT.  THEY ARE NOT INHERENTLY WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING.  If he simply doesn't want to be converted, don't act offended about it.  Do not antagonize the subject of conversion. 
 DO NOT use the term ""peasant"" outside this sub.  This makes all of us look like elitist douchebags.  All members of the human race are brothers, some have simply not seen the light yet, and some may never at all. 
 DO NOT speak down to them.  Treat them like you would a fully ascended brother. 
 DO NOT rebuke everything they say UNLESS you have solid fact to back it up. 
 Bottom line: be mature about it.  If you go in giving the peasant shit about his choice of gaming platform,  you will get shit back. 
 The first picture is a good example of  what not to do.    All he's said there is ""hurr durr master race shit, you're a peasant"".  DO NOT DO THAT.  Keep ""peasantry"" confined to this sub only. 
 It is absolutely  not funny  to provoke a reaction from an unenlightened brother just to rake in a bit of karma.  Those who deliberately do this are no better than the Xbox plebs who ""fucked your mom last night."" ""You're a peasant"" may as well be the same thing. 
 I have enjoy the brother's reaction at the bottom more, though.  He simply stated the facts, and left it at that.  What I'd caution others to avoid there, though, is the entire ""1080p60"" argument.

"So today we were short staffed, i.e. there was one of us on til, one of us on bar and another person on bar support and we're the busiest location in our district. I was working a double and was exhausted. 
 So I was on till for the last hour of my ridiculous shift when this customer comes up in line on his phone. He's talking very loudly and is saying such douchey stuff, and when I said hey, how's it going? He gives me the ""hold on a second"" finger. Now, normally, if there wasn't a line, I'd be like whatever, I'll just go make coffee and come back. But the line looped around our cafe, since it was so busy. So basically this is what went down: 
 Customer:  holds up a finger 
 Me: Oh, sorry, I'll just serve the next customer until you're ready to order  she says super duper nicely 
 C:  death stare  UHM NO, you'll take my order NOW. 
 Me: Uh, uhm, okay, what can I get for you? 
 C:  to the person on the phone  idiot cashier here, hang on. I want an ice coffee. 
 Me: okay, what size would you like? 
 C: Ugh, I don't fucking know, like medium? 
 Me: Sure :) did you want milk or sweetener in that? 
 C:  annoyed, heavy sigh  No I want it black. 
 Me: okay  crosses out syrup box 
 C: oh wait, actually I want caramel syrup. 
 Me: okay, sure. Anything else? 
 C:  HOLDS UP FINGER AGAIN 
 Me:.... 
 C: I also want a FRAPPEECINUUU. 
 Me: Okay, sure, what flavour? 
 C: I don't fucking know, coffee flavoured. 
 Then he just walks away. Still on the phone. Didn't pay. He's walked over to the hand off plane now.

"I think the forbidden nature of the word had unexpectedly increased its utility.  It is not a $20 word, or even a $1,000 word. It has become a $10,000,000 word because of the power of being so very specially forbidden. 
 For example anyone can go on TV and say ""fuckity fuck, shit cock sucking fuck!"", and they might not even have to apologize.  Say ""nigger"" once in the wrong context, and you're done.  You become ""nigger guy"" after that - the guy who dared to utter it. 
 Even using it in a way that lacks aggressive context is perilous.  There is no other word like it.  For example, I recently told a friend: 
 ""I can't believe GOP is re-running their ads about Reverend Wright, to try to damage Obama.  That and bringing back 'welfare' talk.  It's like they are signaling their base to keep hating him.  It's like the GOP is saying 'Don't forget - he's still a nigger!'"" 
 I never call Obama a nigger in that statement, I just point out that his opposition seems to be calling him that.  But still, I'd never dare say that wording to a black guy, even though he might nod his head and say ""Damn right!"".  Too .. fucking .. risky.  In fact, I wouldn't say that to a white person - unless they totally knew me, and knew that I'm not ""like that"".  The potential to be misunderstood while handling that kind of nitroglycerin is too great. 
 This societal censorship sounds like a situation where the word would lose popularity, but the catch is that it only affects people who lack anonymity when they are saying it.  When anonymity is injected into the situation, some people want to wield the power of anonymity.  The rules go away, and that most dangerous-to-touch word is now worth a million dollars of impact.  Drunk on power, it almost becomes some people's ""go-to"" word.",1778,"With anonymity, the word 'nigger' is exposed to new rules that are counter to society's self-imposed normal rules of silence and avoidance.  The self-imposed rules give the word power.  Other slurs like ""kike"", ""spearchucker"", or ""chink"" aren't quite the same.  Nigger is culturally unique.  The word's shock value is recognized as "" 'fuck' x 100"", and it becomes alluring.  Situations arise when black issues come into anonymous conversation, and out it pops.

"I just moved into my new place so I invited 4 of my friends over. One of which was a very old friend of mine whom I have not seen in months. 
 Background on said person:
We've confessed we both had liked each other (a lot) but we were always in an awful on and off relationship with these people we were seeing. When we were both on breaks with relationships we made out, things progressed and we had sex. Unfortunately I was unsatisfied.... Everything is so great about this guy except the size of his dick, it's super shitttttttttttty. I really wasn't ready to jump into a relationship with him after dating someone else for so long and tried to keep things casual like it used to be but he would always make it seem as we were together which was uncomfortable so we stopped communicating for a while. He recently texted me and I thought hey, I miss this guy, come over. 
 Back to the story:
all 5 of us got extremely drunk off wine and vodka to the point where I blacked out, don't remember anyone leaving, vaguely remembering making out with this guy and we both were telling each other how much we really liked each other and than BLANK. Woke up really hung over with no one here and had no underwear on. FUCK. I honestly don't remember having sex with this guy. I had to know, I awkwardly texted him and apologized and he responded "" yeah, we sort of did. You really don't remember?"" What the hell does ""we sort of did"" mean?! 
Now I don't know what to do. I wanted to be friends again but now it's the same. I'm not ready for a relationship still and he left some of his things here so I have to see him again. I just feel like I'm toying with him because I  do  like him and he's really liked me for a long time yet I still don't want anything.

 I'm ok with saying ""op's a fag"" and calling people ""newfags"" and calling homosexuals fags  as a joke . 
 > What it comes down to is that shaming 
 Haha. ""shaming"". Right there with problematic, [trigger warning] and privilege in the list of words that INSTANTLY lose the argument.

 Because it is objectively not. You idiot. 
 > Just know that in modern Western culture, it's considered wrong to hate prostitutes 
 Bawwwwwwwwwwww Western culture. Of course your Western culture is inherently superior to my Oriental savagery. Enlighten me - that is your white man's burden after all. 
 Also, i don't hate prosititutes. I hate the idea of prostitution and I have zero respect for people who choose this ""job"" and continue fucking over sexual relationships within society. 
 > What exactly do you dislike about this scenario? 
 What is there to like about this scenario? First of all, despite your asinine denial, which I will of course discard, this is further establishing the idea of sex as a commodity. Women have sex, men have material value. Men need to exchange sex for money and favours. Except, of course, this is not only prostitution, but prostitution with fraud attached: men're expected to give women money and favours, but not ask for sex in return, just continue pouring that until ding! sex. 
 That is not only disgusting, but also hypocritical. We've established that new feminists are village idiots in frilly suits, right? Right.

"Oh God, where do I begin? 
 When I was in tenth grade, I was in an Honors English class. All my teachers from the years before always LOVED my writing. I passed every possible english class with an A, so I'm not a bad writer. But this teacher.... she just hated me. 
 She was one crazy bitch. She would tell us stories about all the fucked up things she's seen, such as watching a car blow up with someone inside it, or something... I don't remember the details.
So, as you can tell, she's kinda crazy. 
 She gave me C's on everything I wrote. While all the kids who couldn't spell properly, pronounce anything correctly while reading aloud, etc, etc were somehow getting A's, I, a grammar freak at the time, was close to failing the class. I just couldn't understand why. 
 I began to notice that she was obsessed with death. She loved to talk about the Holocaust, she would always make dark jokes, and like mentioned before, her stories were just fucked up. And thus far, all of my written assignments have been cheerful and uplifting, since I'm not some psycopath that worships the devil himself. 
 Then I realized she was failing me because my stories were too happy. She wanted me to write something dark. With blood and gore. 
 So on my final paper, I decided to put my theory to the test. I wrote a short story about a little boy who was bullied constantly by an older kid.  However, I made it as graphic as possible. I made the kid scream, cry, spit blood. The bully kicked his ribs so hard they broke in several places. No one wanted to help the kid. It was a mess. It was so intense, I brought myself to tears writing this horror. And everyone else who read it felt the same. 
 So... I handed that shit in, and you can probably guess my grade.

"Back in stupid high school days, I was in year 9.

 Worried about how much work it will take to improve your life? Decide right now whether it's worth it - would you rather take it easy for the rest of your life and settle for a mediocre standard of living, paycheck to paycheck, or bust your ass for a few years, prop up your ceiling, and  take a shot at your dreams? 
 Sweating how all this will affect your relationships? Get that shit out of the way now. Find out if your lady is willing to support you (emotionally) while you go through all this. If not, she's not worth it.  Find someone who makes you want to be awesome , and wants to help you get there. 
 Worrying is a part of growing up, bro. Every time you discover another way you might fuck everything up, another brick gets added to the load you have to carry as an adult. Just remember:  most of those bricks are not yours . Most of the ways your life can go directly into the shitter, you have absolutely no control over. So  stop trying.  Do the best you can to be as prepared as you can for the foreseeable problems, then forget about the rest.  Only carry your own bricks ; they're much lighter.

"This is liberal bullshit lies because a main pillar of Democratic electoral strategy is massive vote fraud and voter ID laws impinge on their schemes. You need to show ID to do anything in adult life, but for some reason the Dems want to promote the idea that minorities and the young are too stupid to get ID and thus we need to endanger the franchise for ALL voters in order to accommodate these poor stupid people. (That this is liberal racism goes without saying.) 
 Here's a little thought experiment that explains how the Left is lying here: Liberals claim that the only reason for requiring ID is to prevent minorities from voting. If that were so, why don't Dems conduct a drive to get IDs out to EVERYONE? That way when the alleged KKK (which was founded by Democrats BTW) members at the polls try and stop minorities from voting, they could whip out their ID and laugh,  ""BAM! Got my ID, so you can't stop me now, cracker!""  No one who supports voter ID laws is opposed to states handing them out for free to those for whom $10 is too expensive. (Because you need a couple of packs of smokes more or something.) 
 But the Left isn't trying to get IDs into their voters hands because they don't want to solve this supposed problem, they want a fake racism charge to inflame and divide people into sticking with the racist liberal Dems because of fear. Why doesn't the Left call the bluff of those they lie about? A: Because they don't care about people being able to vote; just that fake names on voter rolls can be used to steal elections.

"anyone else not in love with this series so far? cmon i know its issue 1, but....with everything going on in the past few years it doesnt make sense that: 
 scott lang = stupid, poor idiot
cassie lang = oblivious to super-heroism and living a normal life with her mother and going to high school 
 how did that even happen? scott just finished  leading  the fantastic four / future foundation. i'm sure he wouldn't be thrown on the street (even with what is going on with the FF breakup) - he has many friends in powerful places, not just tony. he is an electronics expert, and cracked the code on how to fully unlock and use pym particles, fully surpassing hank pym's abilities. 
 but now he is some dumb dummy who fakes being sick instead of hacking a computer system? 
 last issue we see scott, he is living in a pretty nice place watching movies with darla....you know, his FF team member, who is also a famous popstar ... he introduced her to his daughter, with what seemed the intention to have the two girls involved in each others' lives...did she vanish all of a sudden? 
 cassie had been a superhero and avenger for years. now that she is resurrected by doom, she is just some dumb teen now? forgot all about her growing and shrinking and her years being a total badass with the young avengers and all that? 
 we JUST get cassie back, we JUST get stature back, and they write her into going to HS in miami. yayyyyyyyyyy? 
 now she is some hapless teen all of a sudden living with her mom and going to some PS 100 school in manhattan, and her dad is living in a ramshackle 40sqft studio?

"Take it slow. You should probably begin with telling her you like being submissive. Even if she already figured out you like that it's still good to have it confirmed and out in the open. 
 Then you can continue on with slowly opening up a bit more. Maybe state that you have a lot of kinks, and some might be weird. Like, throwing in some mild kinks like ""I'd love to see your boobs covered in cum"" or ""I'd love to handcuff you"" amongst the pee kink kind of softens it a bit. ""Oh okay, so he's not only into this more outrageous thing."" 
 Also, if you start talking about kinks in general, and if  she  has something she likes.. I'm not sure how open she is, but she might have some kink she feels really embarassed about. Like being spanked, or rape-played or hell, a threesome or whatever. Some kinks might seem really, really mild, but they can be highly embarassing. I thought I'd die when I told my SO that I like being spanked and get choked a bit. He took it in stride, and does it sometimes to please me. In turn he told me about his cosplay kink (which he found embarassing). 
 Or idk, when you've gotten comfortable (without mentioning the pee thing), you can start talking about something you saw ""I saw this video once and I can't get it out of my head. I wonder how it'd feel."" Downplay it. Don't start with ""I'd love for you to piss in my mouth!"". Rather go with a more ""I mean like, I don't think I'd be brave enough to try getting piss in my mouth but I don't know, I'd like to know what it feels like to get peed on. Do you think we could try that in the bath, if you're comfortable? You could sit on my lap and y'know.. let it flow?""

"So, I sometimes dislike social interaction, I guess I could call it very very mild social anxiety. Anyways, my grocery shopping routine is to throw my large headphones on, plug in my headphone amp, and listen to me some dubstep while a shop for food. I never listen at a volume that others can hear unless they are right up in my face. 
 SO 
 I am in the store doing my thing, and I see this older woman coming at me with a look of utter disgust in me, for reasons unbeknownst to me. This old woman is just giving me death stare.... fine. 
 As I'm going through the store I see her couple more times and every time she is staring at me like I was a registered sex offender or something.

I'm going first. 
 Cashier is pleasant, cashes me through, I pay, as I'm bagging my food it happens. A ripe cantaloupe rolls over to my side (you know those cash registers with two lanes so you can self bag while they ring the next person through). 
 I'm on my last bag, cantaloupe rolling down the lane like a bowling ball, hand picked by this woman's 50 some odd years of tapping fruit, she probably spent 20 seconds deciding  that cantaloupe was the one she wanted. I picked it up and was about to say ""OH you lost you cantaloupe old crusty woman"" but no.... I put it in my bag.... threw my headphones on and never looked back. It's literally the only thing I've ever taken.... 
 Now I'm thinking... maybe this woman has a grand-kid at home, all he wanted was a fucking cantaloupe.

A video game website called Giantbomb, created and run by a group of long term friends from a previous website, hired two new staff members. Both highly qualified game writers who have had senior editor positions in well liked publications. Top people for the position. Sounds good, right? They also were however, both white males. Giantbomb has also written several women in gaming articles about sexism and the struggle on being in a male dominant industry. 
 With this news it set off some feminists saying how angry they are at giantbomb. Pretty much labeling them sexist and racist and strongly implying that the guys only hired the new staff members because they were white males and had nothing to do with their credentials. Then this happened. 
 A person asking a totally valid question told to ""Go fuck yourself"" for daring to question her. The conversation goes on into further immaturity and aggressiveness. The giantbomb community picked it up and didn't take too nicely it. They gave her shit back over twitter. Now the whole thing has gone to shit. Just because a website hired a few people. 
 If you want to be an active feminist then great, I support it, but you can't tell someone they're racist, sexist, and anyone who asks a question to fuck off and not expect to cop shit back. Aggressiveness and immaturity attracts aggressiveness and immaturity. If you give intelligent comment and debates then you gain more support and make everyone attacking you seem pettier and sad. It fuels a backslash against feminism and makes them come off super immature, disrespectful, and sexist them self.",1829,"Basically what I'm trying to say in all of this is feminism should be about equal rights, strength, intelligence, understanding, and less hate. It seems like so many feminists these days are working SO hard to counter all of that. If someone questions a point you make then explain it, let them understand your point of view, and give them reasons to go ""I get it now, you're right."". Saying ""Fuck you!"" to anyone who doesn't blindly accept your words is a dangerous path to ignorance and hate.",494,0.8748975396156311,0.9669315814971924,0.0589656643569469,0.0418047346174716,0.7480546832084656,0.884624719619751,0.0138009460642933,0.0031398404389619,0.5266062021255493,0.6397605538368225,0.3457688391208648,0.0620472095906734,"A video game website called Giantbomb, created and run by a group of long term friends from a previous website, hired two new staff members.

So its a standard Friday, I go to the bar and meet up with a bunch of friends. We are all getting drunk and partying hard when ""Yuki"" comes up to me and says that she is very drunk and feeling bad and wants me to take her back to her place. In the taxi she was getting pretty frisky and playful which I can't lie and say I didn't like... BUT when she said she was very drunk was a HUGE understatement.

"A little late to the party, but I'll post it anyways. A few years ago, I was smoking a cigarette, waiting for my shift to start when a homeless guy asked if he could have a smoke. I was running low and was very strapped for cash at this point in time so I told him it was my last one. He knew I was lying, and I felt bad, but he didn't push it and went to go sit on this grassy knoll area in front of the building. 
 Then this tall, blonde woman carrying a bunch of abstract paintings walks up to the homeless guy and says ""Joe, I'm sorry, but you have to go. You know I respect you as a human being, but this is where I'm holding my art show and you can't be here."" Again, he looks pissed, but clearly doesn't think it's worth the argument, and moves again. 
 I'm watching her set up all these shitty paintings, warding anyone off who may ruin her precious art show and thinking ""What a bitch."" When ANOTHER lady comes up to the blonde artist lady and just starts ripping into her. I have no idea what their situation was but the second lady is just screaming at her, ""Kristen! I am so sick and tired of your fucking bullshit! You're 30 goddamn years old! When will you grow up and start taking responsibility for yourself!? You have until tonight to get your fucking paintings out of my house and stop wasting my life and time!"" and the artist lady just pulls into herself like a dejected rabbit as she holds back tears. 
 So me and Joe the homeless guy are just watching her with a combination of ""What the fuck is happening here?"" and ""I'm kind of really enjoying watching this happen right now."" So, I walked over to him, pulled out two cigarettes and my lighter and said ""Joe, I'm sorry I lied to you. That was wrong."" and we smoked a cigarette together while we watched this pretentious artist getting berated by someone she had pissed off.",1847,Formed a special memory with a homeless guy as we watched an uppity artist get the ever living shit yelled out of her and it was magic.,135,0.8978648781776428,0.627396821975708,0.0656575933098793,0.0045407568104565,0.8200610876083374,0.5590093731880188,0.0323512069880962,0.0007197736995294,0.6520332098007202,0.0785614103078842,0.1210927739739418,0.001635440159589,"A few years ago, I was smoking a cigarette, waiting for my shift to start when a homeless guy asked if he could have a smoke.

"Shit, r/politics is leaking.  Oh well. 
 They're not idiots.  You know why?  Because it fucking works.  It's nothing new, it's the same old McCarthy-ist bullshit the right has been doing for decades, but it fucking works.  Why do you think the left came up with the word ""progressive"" instead of liberal?  Because Limbaugh started saying the word ""liberal"" snidely and bullied the left to being ashamed of the word.  I'm sorry, I know we should avoid political discussions in r/NFL, but this was a political post to begin with. 
 There's a [great West Wing clip]( where one of the president's campaign guys sums up my frustration with the left's cowardice on this issue: 
 ""I'm tired of working for candidates who make me think I should be embarrassed to believe what I believe, Sam.  I'm tired of getting them elected.  We all need some therapy, because somebody came along and said ""liberal"" means soft on crime, soft on drugs, soft on communism, soft on defense, and we're gonna tax you back to the stone age, because people shouldn't have to go to work if they don't want to.  And instead of saying,  EXCUSE ME, you RIGHT-WING, REACTIONARY, XENOPHOBIC, HOMOPHOBIC, ANTI-EDUCATION, ANTI-CHOICE, PRO-GUN, LEAVE-IT-TO-BEAVER TRIP BACK TO THE FIFTIES, we cowered in the corner ... and said ""please don't hurt me.""  No more. 
 The same fucking thing happened with the term ""socialist"".  I would have have been the least bit surprised if guys in pick up trucks started going around knocking on doors to look for socialists.  Now, I'm not a liberal, democrat, progressive, whatever.  I'm not those things.  And I think it's absurd to think that because ""socialism"" works for football it can work for the country,  but it's a debate worth having .  In the open, instead of forcing people to be ashamed of having a different opinion about government.

"ok We've been together for 3 years with one kid. a kid i was very reluctant to have even when i found out she was pregnant it took me a long time to come to terms that i was going to be a dad and when he was born it wasn't until he was 13/14 months that i finally accepted and started loving him.. its weird me saying that i love him since hes mine.. but there's not a day that goes by wishing i was stronger and said no i don't want a kid or when i listened to my families advice saying it will be the best thing ever 
 he's nearly 17 months now and hes adorable. its difficult its very difficult i find but apparently thats normal. There are times where i wanted to murder him but once again iv been told thats normal? 
is it though? 
 anyway all through the 17 months my girlfriend has repeatedly said she wants another one within the next 2 years and iv always ALWAYS said no and that i want a vasectomy and she's always been please dont and all that. 
 I dont want another kid under any circumstances. its just too difficult and im poor as it is 
 Anyway last month i finally got my act together and booked in a doctor for the vasectomy talk and prices (she doesn't know) 
 cue 2 days ago i find out shes pregnant from 3 weeks ago cuz silly old me didn't use a condom. Now i fully take the blame here.
Shes delighted and im not at all happy.. 
 My question is.. im not sure where to go on this. in a way another child would be cool but i just dont want to go through all that hell again.. 
im a bit lost at the moment and i havent talked to my parents or friends
I cant ask her for a abortion because i know for a fact she wont get one. so im debating leaving her but then that fucks a really good thing i have going with her. Im conflicted as fuck and i need a few other opinions or just advice from other people.. from other dads from whoever

"When I was about 18, I went to this party with my best friend. 
 Now I have to paint the scene a little: this was  not  an awesome party. It was basically a fucking shack at the edge of a wooded area, where someone had put a stereo. There was booze and weed. That's how we rolled in the nineties. 
Also, it was October, and like 45 degrees out.  (EDIT: that's like 7 degrees Celsius) 
 My best friend had a boyfriend, and upon arriving at this ""party"", it turns out he had brought a friend, that I was immediately left alone with since friend and boyfriend fucked off into the woods within seconds. 
 We talked a little. He was nice. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk. Sure, why not. 
 Well one thing led to another of course and we started making out between the trees. He started taking off my clothes and without any foreplay whatsoever, he was inside me, at which point I realized I WAS FUCKING FREEZING. 
I had twigs and shit sticking up in my ass and leaves in my hair, and I remember laying there, teeth chattering, thinking: what the fuck am I doing here? 
And he wasn't even close to finishing. He just kept going and going, which was probably the only thing preventing my lady parts from freezing off. 
 I figured I'd let him finish, but after ten minutes he was still going with no end in sight, so through shattering teeth I murmured something along the lines of: ""d-d-d-dude i-i-i-i-it's n-n-n-not g-g-going t-t-t-to h-h-h-happen"". 
 We put our clothes back on in awkward silence and went back to the cesspool of horrors, where I found my friend and told her I wanted to go. She laughed her head off when I told her the story, and again when I pulled a fucking twig out of my bra when we were changing for bed that night.

"Ok, first of all big sean is really talented and underrated on this sub, people only hear his singles and features and judge him, they need to hop on his dick and bump finally famous volume 2 and 3, shit was fire. I was actually gonna make a post about it once i mustered up enough fucks to give. 
 That being said, Danny Brown is that nigga. Watch some of his interviews, watch him rap in the studio. He is one of the most realistic, non fuckin around ass niggas in the rap game. I'd say his music is less bullshit and exaggeration then most people, his personality is pretty close to his music. That's evidenced in lines like ""smokin on some dirt weed smellin like some firewood"" and shit like that, he just seems so much more human and relatable than most rappers. I don't even think he is really that wealthy yet, even though he is pretty popular. He hasn't sold any albums or had any popular singles really. His personality is just infectious, he is funny and clever and really likeable. 
 Now for his actual music. A lot of people talk shit about danny brown beats; once again, i think they just need to dismount that dick and have an open mind. The beats he spits on aren't really terrifically produced, but they just sound so raw and personal. Like i could picture one dude takin two hours, smokin a blunt and workin on fl studio on his laptop, puttin like 30 beats on a flash drive and givin that shit to danny, and danny just spazzing on it in the living room on a 50 dollar mic from target. His bars are phenomenal; the shit he says and the way he flows are years ahead of his time and extremely original. I suggest listening to xxx again, and again and again.

"Hello fellow gamers and Redditers alike, I have a very serious issue to discuss with you, and this is the fact that I really....really would like a copy of Garry's mod. 
 ""You cheap bastard! It's 2.49 right now! go buy it yourself!"" 
 Well, I would..but here's the problem. In order for me to buy the game, I would have to transfer the funds from my checking acct. to Paypal, and this takes at least 3 business days. Being that it's already 10:19 on a Friday, by the time the banks would even begin processing my transaction, the sale would be over. 
 ""You stupid bastard! you should of done this earlier!"" 
 I know, I know, but to be honest I diddn't even know about the sale until today... 
 ""You stupid bastard! you're not on top of gaming news, your probably not even a ""gamer"" so why should we help you!?"" 
 Honestly, I love games.. 
 Unfortunately due to my current conditions (mostly hardware issues), my gaming groove has been knocked off. I have been starting to pick up once again courtesy of a new PSU, and have been enjoying the likes of FEAR 3 (spooky!) and Superpower2 (I highly suggest to anyone that would be interested in playing a wargames-style rts). 
 ""Well...why Garry's Mod?"" 
 Mostly because my younger brother who lives cross country (I only get to see him like once a year) loves to play it. We don't get to bond on much anymore, and I figured that what could be better then joining him in the virtual playgrounds and connecting with him over some game! Also, some other friends have copies that I would love to play with. 
 ""Well, what do I get out of it?"" 
 Well, I suppose I could do a few different things, I could do requested humors things within reason and post pictures of said things. I also would be willing to host a super awesome Gmod (once I have a copy) or a Superpower 2 server, if anyone even has a copy.

"Sorry if you are offended at any time. 
 Anyways, yesterday one of my friends wanted to come over to my place without acknowledging that today was mothers day. Thats his first mistake. Later on we went to the beach, second mistake. He managed to make me tell him about my depression, my self harm issues, and even my depersonilization. When we got back home, i was in my bed and he was in the sleeping bag on the floor, we started talking about all that. 
 Now, before i go on, this guy has apparantly had a 3 year old depression. He also seems to believe EVERYTHING EVER BECAUSE HE IS THE BEST PERSON EVER BLAH BLAH BLAH. 
 So, he went on with the usual bullshit im told every time i open up, ""its bad"" ""why are you depressed"" ""cutting is not healthy"" ""you dont have a reason to be depressed"" Well, let me say that after 6 years of depression, i dont need a damn reason to be depressed, i know cutting aint gonna do me good, its my way of coping! He then told me to just snap out of it. Since im Canadian, i didnt fucking snap at him and instead was just polite as usual. I opened up too much actually. I even went as far as showing him my cuts, and told him i actually consider cuts as trophies. Fucked up, i know, but he told me, and i quote ""You consider these trophies?! A trophy is a fucking achievement! What the fuck is wrong with you?"" This hit me harder than i thought. 
 Also, before hating, i know that this guy cant handle his emotions, iknow he probably just doesent uderstand. But i cant take the IGNORANCE of these people. I jus want to beat the shit of them or at least throw a chair at their face and tell them that this is what depression feels like, only its all day, every day.

Donate your massive pile of new-found money to charity.  Don't support corporations who don't support charity.  Show them that you give a shit.  Organize against them.  Protest Wall Street and demand that your super-uber-rich donate to charity as well.

"This weeaboo was a slight friend of mine in middle school. 
 I was a pretty weird kid, and her obsession with anime was unattractive to anyone around her, outside of her anime loving friends. 
 We chatted on facebook a lot, and while I wasn't nearly as huge of a fan as her, I had a Shonen Jump Subscription (I was dumb) that allowed me to keep up with the latest in manga. 
 That is, until one day. 
 I was checking my facebook news feed, and all of the sudden, there were dicks on my screen! Anime dicks too! She had liked some yaoi photo on facebook, and it was on my news feed, along with many of my other friends. I checked her account to see if it was hacked, and there were links to other profiles, one of them being an account that had mutual friends with me, in addition to a Furry OC profile picture. 
 Boy was I not expecting what I was going to see. 
 After clicking the account, I found out that she had drawn yaoi all over her facebook account! This was weird as fuck! 
 So I messaged her to ask if she had been hacked or something, and it turned out that this was all real. I was the fucker for not accepting her or something, I called her weird as fuck, and she blocked me. Standard. 
 So about 2 weeks later, she brings a big ass hunting knife into school. Yeah. That scared the shit out of everyone. No one was hurt, and she was suspended for a decent amount of time, but it was trippy as fuck to see her pull a knife that looked like [this]( out of a backpack covered in characters from Death Note, Naruto, etc. 
 Apparently, her anime friends were trying to out weeb each other by talking about japanese weapons and shit. One of the girls started talking about how she got a Katana from a convention her dad took her to, so this girl tried to one up her by talking about her Japanese knife.

"I was going to make a reply comment, but I guess I'll just post. Down in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam was at a club and what I thought to be an attractive girl was quite keen on me (dark club). She spoke English well enough and told me she lived in Cali most of the time. So we go take a taxi back to her place, with her flamboyant brother in the front seat who is constantly telling me how it's good I'm going to fuck his sister. Weird. So we take a taxi way the fuck away from where I'm staying. At this point, in the back of my mind I'm like, 'Fuck, this could end really poorly.' I'm a rather built guy, but in SE Asia I don't think it's really the place you want to take chances. 
 Anyways, we get to the apartment.. and it's one of the nicest apartments I've been in. So I'm chillin on the couch listening to some tunes from the Weeknd, gettin into the mood and her brother comes out in, I shit you not, a woman's night gown. V-cut, super short. And I'm just like, 'shit.' He pulls out a plate from the fridge and starts scraping something off with a credit card. She goes over to join him and they both ask if I want some 'K'. Now, I've done quite a bit of drugs in my 25 years, but I have no fucking idea what 'K' is and I opt out, because uncertainty n shit. 
 They start going to town on this stuff and it's like 4 in the morning. Long story short, she gets sick and starts throwing up. I go lay down in her incredibly comfortable bed and set an alarm for two hours from then, when I'll get the fuck outta there. She comes in to the room and starts trying to make it happen and I straight up say, 'Nah, just go to sleep. Don't worry about it.' Well comfort got the better of me and I'm a lazy fuck, so I turned off my alarm and woke up around 10 to have her brother, still dressed scantily, to cook me some eggs.

"Basically from what I've gathered, it can be many things. 
 It can be misery that lasts for months. You can go home and just cry for what feels like no reason at all other than that you're miserable. It's basically like being done and frustrated with your life as it is. This type can make you feel like braking down crying in the middle of the crosswalk, or even with your best friends. You are full of emotions, but none of them are positive, and you seriously consider ending it. 
 Then there's the apathetic type. You break, and can be described as simply not giving a damn anymore. You lose all sense of well-being, and instead of misery, it's an eternal nothing. Instead of crying on the crosswalk, you kind of want a car to hit you. You just don't care if you go somewhere, talk with friends, or even die that day. You lose your ability to feel anything, even love, and begin to wonder after so long if you've always been so apathetic. You don't want to go to school, but the work is more trouble than it's worth. You want to run away somewhere, to just escape, but it's more trouble than it's worth. You don't WANT to die, you just don't care. Not about the future, your life, the lives around you. All your feeling just got bottled away by whatever this void that envelops you is. 
 There are more, but I think those are the two main ones. It can be hard to get help for, because you are convinced you're just being a bitch, that you don't even deserve to bother anyone with how you feel. I'm not even convinced I have it. I haven't felt the same for over a year, and I still convince myself I'm fine most of the time. It's just a period of dread and emptiness, and you don't even know what you want to make you feel better. At this point, I don't even care if I get up in the morning, let alone get help. That's how depression feels.

"Okay my guy roommate and girl roommate who are dating (mid 20's) and i went out to a bar last night.  My guy roommate got REALLY fucked up but it was hilarious i dared him to chug a pint of long island iced tea, he just got obliterated.  We felt bad last night.  He threw up in bed and in the bathroom on the floor and in the bathtub its a disaster (i share this bathroom with both of them, theres another bathroom downstairs but the other roommate uses that one and i guess its cool for us but thats besides the point).

This morning girl roommate was sort of pushing him to clean it and she relaxed about it.  But in the last hour or so shes FLIPPING a shit. 
 My guy roommate is trying to sleep it off and feel a bit better before he cleans (which i understand).  But she is completely fucking bugging out like consistently SCREAMING in his face while hes laying on the couch and shes hitting him with pillows over, and over and over again saying ""GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP""
Shes been saying she deserves better than him and just being totally evil is all i can sum it up as. 
 Now from his perspective this is NEVER going to motivate me to do shit, and its also not worked yet so i dont understand why shes being so persistent here.  And i feel like shes in the wrong what does reddit think? 
 If i had a girlfriend who got that smashed, i honestly would have been the one to clean it up because shit happens and its not the end of the world.

"I take non-existence.... 
 I'm already intelligent enough to know most of the people around me are mentally handicapped which annoys the hell out of me.  I'd imagine knowing everything would make that problem considerably worse and due to the restrictions forced upon taking that option there wouldn't be a while lot you could about it. 
 Eternal Childhood might be great for some people, but I hated my childhood and would rather die than relive it. 
 Eternal love, as described in the picture at least, would feel fake to me.  It would be as though it was forced on them like a programmer telling a robot to love me.  It just wouldn't feel right at all. 
 Infinite power would be absolutely awesome, but I'd very likely fuck it up and lose everything.  For instance you need to keep your population under control and the best way to do that is to have the public wanting to do something that controls them.  As such I would run fiber to every home and then gives sites like reddit free tv time to advertise.  Now that the vast majority of my population would sooner press a mouse button to downvote something I've said than actually doing something about it I would be able to get away with just about anything I wanted.  The only problem though is now everyone has ridiculously good internet connections and a reddit addiction so my bidding is now being thwarted by cat pictures and rage comics. 
 That leaves non-existence.  Now I must have existed if I were to have chosen this option which means god must kill me.  I figure having god kill me is better than cancer or some other horrific medical condition and since there is an afterlife that I can't be a part of it means that I get to avoid my dead relatives forever.

Cool, I've been trying to tell her this from the start, I give her my license, insurance, phone number, the works, but now she won't give me her information, thinks I'm trying to extort her or something, going on about ""It's not my fault! I did nothing wrong! No no no!!""

"That I had told ""everyone"" that this one girl from class was a bitch and that people shouldn't talk to her. So she decided to confront me with her bullshit. Pretty normal for a 7th grader. Except this was the first year of university. 
 I arrive at a party Friday night that another girl from class was throwing. I'm the first dude to get there, and the girl who's giving the party greets me and instantly tells me I better go into the living room because there's someone who really wants to talk to me. Which was confusing, but it seemed genuine, so also a little unsettling. I take off my shoes and jacket and walk in to a table of 7-8 girls from class that invite me to sit down because Maria (yeah, that's her real name, fuck her) wants to talk to me. So she gives me her side of the story, and all I can really answer is that I have no flipping idea where  she  got that idea. I fucking hate gossip and I didn't even have anything against her. They've basically been talking about me for an hour - all of them, and apparently nobody challenged it since she'd had kind of a rough patch after her dad had gone through surgery. So I have to defend myself against this fucking ghost story which turns into very general accusations that I need to think about how I'm acting around other people and that I might come off as arrogant sometimes, you know? This went of for at least an hour. What I really wanted to do was of course tell them they were stupid petty bitches and just leave, but I felt like that would only support them in their collective brainmelt and stigmatize me even further. So I stayed through it. And through the party. At one point the older sister of the girl living there told me overbearingly: ""Listen... I think I might be able to help explain. I've been acting as a kind of  moderator  tonight."" Jesus. Worst night ever.

"Technically yesterday but living with the effects today. Can guarantee that this is going to go the opposite of how most are expecting to go. 
 Necessary background info:
I was totally straight laced my entire life. I live in Oregon and my boyfriend is a stoner who lives in Washington and recently got me smoking weed. I have horrible stomach problems that are currently still undiagnosed. But part of what's been discovered is I've become both lactose and gluten intolerant out of nowhere. As a result I've spent the last two and a half weeks on a diet that's completely dairy and gluten free. Which means everything delicious and fun is gone. 
 Now, leading up to the FU. Boyfriend got me a bong and some weed for my birthday. I had decided to say fuck it and eat food that wasn't in the range of safe things to eat because it was my birthday. Agony ensues. A little while after dinner we go to my room and smoke a bit. I take one hit all my stomach pain is completely gone. 
 My boyfriend had to go back to Washington and later that night I had stomach pain again. I smoke again and just like before all pain is gone. It's still my birthday so I say fuck it again and I begin to completely binge on dairy and gluten like a rabid wolverine. You name it I probably shoved it down my craw. Then I start on all the other things I couldn't eat. Lots of sweets. Nothing is triggering my stomach pain. I don't stop. Nothing could harm me! I was laughing in the face of the gods. 
 Well in my hubris, I forgot that eating a bunch of unhealthy bullshit is going to upset my stomach like it would anyone else for obvious reasons. And I got the mother of all stomach aches and nausea. Not even the dankest of weed could save me.

"So, I don't know why I'm writing this, I'm not the kind of guy to talk with anyone about feelings, never did. And nothing bad really happened but I'm kinda miserable now and don't know what to do. 
 So I dreamed last night that my mom died in an accident. Wasn't a long dream because I woke up pretty fast in shock. I know it's just a dream but it was so fucking bleak and terrible, that dream was one of the worst feelings I ever had. In the dream I woke up and my sister came in my room and looked at me and I immediately know what was up (I guess because in real life I thought about this a lot, because a good friend lost his mom some time ago and I imagined a lot how i wouldve felt and I guess that kinda transitioned into my dream) and I broke down and cried, for the whole dream. I cried so much that there weren't anymore tears coming out. Then I went into the living room where the rest of my family sat, it rained outside. It was like in a very cliche movie. The worst thing was that in the dream my father told me that my mom went to go pick up a package in the post office or something and I (like always in real life) slept very fucking long and instead of waking me up what my father suggested she let me sleep and picked it up on her own. And on the way she died. 
 I've never felt so much guilt and shame. I know it's just a dream but that is exactly what my mom would have done. Not wake my lazy ass up to go herself. It made me seriously consider what I'm doing with my life. 
 Sorry if that makes no sense and is not really worth posting at all but I'm really a mess right now. I'm crying like a bitch because I realized that I would be fucking devestated if something like that happened because I never tell my parents how much I love them and what they mean to me, and I couldn't forgive myself if something happened to them and the last thing I said to them would be that I don't want to be bothered right now or some fucked up thing like that.",1967,"tell your family that you love them.

"And maybe those people are fucking retarded? The whole ""purist"" attitude some people have is so stupid, especially when they want us to use PayDay with a Meowth we can't catch, or to remove the step limit, which is blatantly cheating.

There is an impending doom waiting for us if we run out of money, and we only have a small number of tries to get past this place before something drastic (aka cheating) takes place. 
 What should happen is that ""start9"" and honestly anything above ""start"" should be ignored at all times. If you want to spam with start, go ahead, but don't make the stream unwatchable to the people who want progress and who want to watch something more than the menu popping up every 2 seconds. Then, when democracy is chosen, you should vote anarchy to get it back and let the democrats do their work until your precious ""pure"" mode is back. 
 Really, I think if people really wanted progress, the anarchy/democracy vote system would have to go away. The average input stream is about 50% democracy or anarchy, with the other half at least attempting to do something in game. This percentage jumps to well over 90% when one side is about to win, and I think the voting system impedes progress more than start9 or anything that trolls or bots could ever do. We could have made literally twice as many steps if it wasn't for the voting system, but as it is, democracy is a choice and people should learn to deal with it rather than being immature asshats about it.",1973,Be excellent to each other.,27,0.9859604835510254,0.0005709743709303,0.1016006991267204,0.0001477624900871,0.9398982524871826,0.0002166915073757,0.0045053930953145,0.0001505999971413,0.8453958034515381,0.000188254925888,0.1444524675607681,0.0001504771207692,"The voting system impedes progress more than anything trolls or bots could ever do.

"I really don't get why people on DayZ have to be such fucks to one another, especially when they're picking on freshies. 
 Like, I've taken it upon myself to be a bandit hunter. The other day I was siting in the North-East Airfield, and a guy with a funny Russian name spawned in the building along with me (heard the sound of his gun loading) and he was telling me over chat that he couldn't hear me talking through his Microphone (which ended up being horseshit) and that his friend was watching me in the building. Turns out his little friend was ghosting as I had set myself up in a small room with the door closed upstairs and suddenly his ""friend"" materialises infront of me and I of course, had to shoot him. As soon as this guy went down, his other friend (the one camping me in) combat logged and server hopped. So I spent the next 2 hours trying to find said guy by hopping trough all different types of servers and I met what I was informed was a brand new player. Totally new to the game and I was right behind him with my M4 punted at his head. Naturally I told him not to put anything in his hands (like a hidden pistol) or I'd cap him (trust no one, live long). This man explained to me that it took him 4-5 of running around just to get to this location. He had no weapon, no food and no water. So I took it upon myself to give him my Fireaxe, my Magnum and 20 rounds for it, some opener cans of beans and a full water canteen. Then I explained to him to constantly reference the DayZ map so he knows where he is, and to always find a well/sign in a town to get his bearings. 
 Stayed and talked with this guy for 24 minutes, waiting for a bandit I'd been chasing through all different servers to appear. Now this new guy was kind enough not to shoot me in the face with the Magnum I have him, and I could really hear the appreciation in his tone of voice for helping him out and giving him a ton of pointers for the game.

"Christ I'm sick of having this idiotic argument. 
 First, I've got a copy of the Qur'an which I've read a couple of times (photo available at   I've also read the Bible more than a few times (thanks 12 years of Catholic education). 
 Believe me when I saw that there is just as much, if not more violence in the Bible as in other religious texts - particularly as far as non-believers go. 
 People either don't realise or don't know that the first instructions that God gave to the Israelites after Moses brought down the Ten Commandments (including ""thou shalt not kill) was to slaughter 3,000 people for worshipping a false idol (the Golden Calf) - Exodus 32:26-28: 
 >  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' 
 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
 What's my view of extremist Muslims cherry-picking the Qur'an to justify their views?  Pretty much my view of extremist Christians cherry picking the Bible to back up their idiotic view points. 
 You see this a lot when Christians quote the book of Leviticus as an argument against against homosexuality - Usually Leviticus 20:13, which states the penalty for a man laying with another man is death for both. 
 These fuckwits are very, very selective over which parts of Leviticus they choose to quote.  I don't see many of them too eager to bring up the stupid ones which are long since obselete, e.g.: 
 
 Having messy hair - punishable by death (Lev 10:6). 
 
 Eating lobster (""seafood without fish or scales"") - (Lev 11:10). 
 
 Going to church within a month of having a baby boy, or two months if it's a girl (Lev 12:4-5). 
 
 Bestiality - both the man and the animal are to be put to death - (Lev 20:15). 
 
 Blasphemy - stoning to death (Lev: 24:14).",1987,"both the Bible and the Qur'an are ancient texts that can selectively quoted to meet the agenda of whoever is reading it.

""Adc you fcking noob your 1/4/1"" retorts top.

I don't think ""Black"" people are different from me, but their culture sure as hell is different than mine.

"So, hear me out on this...might be talking out of my ass, but growing up in a farming town, perhaps this is a unique perspective on things. 
 So, according to  this .  Quite literally, the United States is a breadbasket for the world, and we're probably one of the few countries left in the world that would be able to sustain ourselves internally (food wise, at least) should imports/exports be completely cut off (in the event of war or nuclear holocaust or aliens or something). 
 Keep in mind, many people in the government are holdovers from the days of the Cold War.  This is their exact mentality, that global nuclear war is just around the corner and there's some form of catastrophe just waiting to befall the United States or the world at large.  They know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that when the terrorists hate our freedom enough, they'll destroy everything and all we'll be left with is our fallout shelters and our fertile, rich soil. 
 So, here's the theory, fleshed out. 
 Their reasoning is, if they were to legalize trees outright, that so much of our food-producing infrastructure would be converted to producing trees that we, as a nation, would no longer be able to sustain ourselves agriculturally.  They believe that the minute that Marijuana is legalized, all of our fields and crops and millions of acres of farmland will be plowed over, and in the place of Corn or Wheat or Soybeans or what have you, farmers will begin to plant Marijuana exclusively, because it will be worth SO much more than any other crop they can plant. 
 Of course, some of the biggest farm-centric companies and lobbying groups probably also know this, being that they would (at least initially) see a drop in profits.  No one would want to buy trees with herbicide or pesticide laced into the plant.  What's more, they'd lose a bit of monopoly on seed production, being that they wouldn't have produced (at that point, at least) a genetically perfect plant. 
 Anyway.  Those are my thoughts/theories/rantings.

"Anyone care to share their drunk 'fuck yeah' stories? Example below: 
 I was out at a bar called The Green Room one Wednesday night. They used to have a thing on Wednesdays called ""Ladies 80's"" where people would dress like they were from the 80's, play appropriate music, etc. One of the kickers about Ladies 80's was they had a certain time frame where you could buy drinks for 25 cents. Doubles 50 cents, etc. They were smaller cups, but still roughly a shot for 25 cents. 
 As you can probably tell, this meant that drunks and poor people flooded the place most times. So, I'm sitting near the bar, waiting for some room to order and get my drink on (more). (I'm not an asshole, and won't shove people out of the way for a drink) 
 I'm pretty drunk at this point, but I notice these two guys at the bar who keep eyeing me down. They were watching me for some reason... 
 After a little bit, they flag me down and say ""hey, you can get your drink over here,"" and make some room for me to order. I think fucking awesome! So I ask the dudes if they wanted a drink. They were happy, and grateful, but something was still off. 
 I tell the bartender to get me 3 shots of white rum. He says I can't get all of those for myself, so I point at the two strangers, who are giggling and laughing to themselves like school girls. As the bartender left to get my order I realize these dudes are making fun of me. They're joking about how drunk I am, making fun of me one way or another, or something.

"Throw away account. 
 Starts out with a kid that my friends HATE. Lets call him Slim. We literally want him dead. My friend (Tom) (also my best friend) somehow was talking to Slim about how me, Tom, and couple other friends did shrooms, dropped acid and smokes weed. 
 Slim tells Tom's sister. Gr8. 
 So his sister is a bitch so i knew she was gonna tell Tom's mom. So i was gonna go over to his house to back Tom up bout us not doing other drugs. Tom's mom and sister were gonna call the cops on me so i couldn't. I gotten in trouble with the popo before so i didn't feel like dealing with that shit at the moment so i had to go to another friends house, his neighbors. 
 Fast forward a couple hours to me smoking a bowl or 2 to chill out since i was freaking out since i sell acid and have other drugs in my room still. (hidden pretty well but still). Anyway they somehow make Tom tell them everything. Me doing drugs this other person doing drugs ect ect. We all know each other and live next to eachother. Except me thankfully. I live quite aways. My parents don't know Tom's parents. So heres where i get creative. I have couple spare local numbers to text people and stuff. So Tom's sister asked a friend for my mom's number. So i have him give them my fake number acting as my mom. After a hour of texting her mom (still acting like my mom) she fucking buys it. Also tell her not to text my dad and let ""me"" (as my mom) to handle it from here. I dont even know how it happened but it did. 
 So (i think) im off the hook... 
 Also somehow they got Tom to say who he got weed from, said the dealers name. So yeah, you got my dealer and his gang of buddies, me, 3 other friends, my other friend apparently sells coke and meth according to Tom's mom and sister all after Slim. Gonna be a next fun days. 
 I'm having another friend of mine hold on to my shit for a week or so just to let the dust settle just incase his parents somehow get in touch with my parents. Idk how they will but rather just be safe. 
 Any advice on what else to do?

"I mean seriously? I'm not.  You had to have seen this coming.  How could you not expect this kind of hatred and ignorance for a person they probably knew nothing about.  I fully expected to see this as a day of celebration for those assholes; a chance to 'thank god' for removing that man from this earth.  It's disgusting.  Unfortunately I was not disappointed in the least.  I've read through several hundred facebook and twitter posts and it is just a shame. 
 How christian of them to wish death upon another human being, to thank god for punishing a man who contributed more to society and the human race than any of them combined, and to piss and moan about a fucking hashtag on the internet (#godisnotgreat)--that didn't start as someone's opinion and caught on--but is the title of an amazing book.  I am embarrassed to say that I could be related to those people somehow.  If there was a being worthy of being called god, I assume it would be looking at them with disgust and pity for people behaving in such a way.  This is why religion disgusts me and also why I feel like I personally lost an acquaintance today.  I looked forward to his essays and am sad that I won't get his insight on the world's current events. 
 These people have shown a complete lack of respect and intelligence in trashing his name and reputation.  Judging by the superb spelling and intelligence they've shown in their posts, I'm sure a large portion of them hadn't even heard of him before today, let alone read any of his writings, and didn't hesitate to celebrate him dying.  Do they not realize they're going to die too?  Do they not understand DEATH is a natural occurrence from which no amount of praying (wishful thinking) will enable them to avoid? 
 Why do people have to be such assholes?  What happened to treating people the way they want to be treated?  What happened to respect?  Tact?  Common fucking decency?  There is no reason to say things they've said or act the way they do.  Shame on them, I hope they get what they deserve in some form or another.",2058,I feel like we lost a friend today.

"That eugenics is an unethical practice. I believe it's sound science with bad PR. You get the whole Godwin's law thing out of the way and you've got the potential to end terrible epidemics simply by cutting off the genetic transference line. It's not PC to say that some people shouldn't have the right to reproduce, because of this whole ""disability pride movement"" and bullshit like ""autism is a unique gift"" and ""bipolar disorder is linked to great art"" and ""but what about Jerry Seinfeld."" 
 People need to get their heads out of their asses and recognize that the majority of genetic defectives are  not  going to be Jerry Seinfeld, Einstein or Van Gogh. Somehow we got the idea that not allowing Jenny McCarthy's kid to have a litter of shit-eating anime freaks is a civil rights violation and makes Martin Luther King cry in his grave. Or that DNA is pseudoscience and there's only one thing that causes autism: THOSE EVIL VACCINE NEEDLES AND OBAMA IS COVERING T UP!!!11!! 
 Bullshit. Probably most every illness known to man is transferred from one parent to another. We need to start quarantining the defectives and studying their DNA so that we can weed out the chaff and prevent the major ""invisible"" epidemics from perpetuating. Specifically the mental illness epidemic which we don't even want to talk about unless ""MUH GUNZ"" is mentioned somewhere in the discussion. Or the Spergies for Freedom special-snowflake crowd pipes up. Or Glenn Close makes a PSA about her (ahem)  biological  sister. Or whatever. 
 People make a big deal about Monsanto ""playing God"" with tomatoes. Maybe they should shut up about the damn tomatoes and let science ""play God"" by sterilizing idiots and special snowflakes so that they can't continue to breed their defective genes.

 I had many mixed emotions reading your previous post, and most especially this recent one. 
 On one hand, I feel very bad for you.  You've really had your nose rubbed in shit. 
 But at the same time, I have to admit...I find myself annoyed reading your account of your misfortune. 
 You come across as a glutton for punishment, intent on self sabotage and half measures.  And of course, you have seen so far how that goes. 
 I'm not proposing you do anything to get yourself into serious trouble. 
 But if you are too frightened or squeemish to fuck with these people (your faithless ex and this pig she's been screwing), you just need to disappear and quit poking the cage.  It's not how I'd roll, but I understand why someone would choose this.  Some people really are just very passive, and not ""fighters"" of any sort. 
 However if you do want some satisfaction, you have to stop being concerned with getting permission from the very people you want to carve a piece out of.  For instance, this calling up dickhead  first  -  why?!! 
 This wishy-washiness and indecisiveness may be a symptom of greater problems for you.  And while nothing will excuse what your fiancee did to you, I have to say that it may play a part in what happened.  Or at the very least (on some level) it is what led you to be with a woman like this.  Our decision making processes are a great deal more subtle than most people acknowledge.  One must dig them up and expose them to light in order to truly understand.  Most say they know what they think - they only speak from the depths of their ignorance. 
 One last thing - you don't miss this woman.  The dog perhaps.  But not this woman.  You miss your mental conception of what you  thought  you had with her, and who she was for you.  You miss the familiarity. 
 You need to smash that idol.",2060,"For your own sake,  shit or get off the pot.   Whatever you choose, be 100% and you'll find your way out of this sooner than later.

"How To Augment Your Receiving of Oral Sex 
 ~A Reddit Gentleman's Guide~ 
 Fellas, it's important to practice good hygiene. At least if you want to run your life in a way that will maximize the amount of time your partner's mouth spends on junk. I'm about to get into some shit that I've seen much success with. So listen up. 
 They say nothing if you can't say nice things. Well, let me say there is nothing nice about smelly balls. The philosophy here is that you want to make your manly bits as welcoming as possible. Think of the reverse situation: Do you like going down on a hairy, smelly cooch? I thought not. You can't fix that shit with a piece of gum. Nor can you ask the dope to pass the soap. 
 This is what goes through a woman's mind when she realizes you are starting to expect oral sex. Chances are you're not a poster boy. Your balls can't be smelling like the type that soap avoid. So you have to take steps to care for your body so that you are as appealing as possible. Polish that turd, as Colbert would say, the turd being your round, pear-shaped body. 
 Basically, take a fancy 5-blade razor and a new blade and get in the shower and lather up your balls. Very carefully, shave all the hair off your balls. Do this once a week to get rid of testicular stubble. Then, take a shower every day. Yes, every day. If you can't afford it for some reason, take a shower every day you will see your lady (or gentleman, for the gay redditors out there). Next, invest in some scentless, allergen-free bar soap. Every time you shower, lather up the ole cock ’n’ balls real good. Then get your armpits and every other part of your body. 
 Invest in a small pair of scissors. Trim your pubic hair to a quarter- to half-inch in length. This is important. Ladies appreciate manscaping. 
 See, every man's body is different. Every man will have a different musk. Don't cover it up with bullshit fragrances. Just scrub yourself with soap as much as you can and apply some deodorant. Otherwise, you'll smell like brimstone, and girls will never, ever take you home.",2069,"Wash your ass, if you must. Wash your hair, if you must. Brush your teeth, if you must.

"Slowly, in hospital, of liver failure and related complications. 
 We once had a patient who came in for liver failure. What a lot of people don't know is that when your liver goes bad, toxins build up in your system and make you lose your mind. Dementia sets in pretty quickly. We can give you a medication to help you with that, but it makes you shit 6 times a day. 
 Now imagine being old and weak, stuck in a hospital bed, shitting yourself and not understanding what's happening to you. Your mind breaks down so far that you forget how to eat. So we put in a feeding tube (at the request of your spouse) and you, in your confused state, pull it out at least once a day. So we restrain your hands, putting them in mitts or tying them to the bed. We try our best to turn you freguently, to prevent bedsores, but the skin on your backside is so broken down from all the watery shit that eventually you get a little ulcer. 
 This little ulcer slowly but surely turns into a big ulcer because you are old and don't heal well, until it goes nearly down to the bone. You get an infection, so we put you on antibiotics. These antibiotics give you a different kind of shit; life threatening. So you get stronger antibiotics. 
 Meanwhile, you're not up and about so you start getting pneumonia from not being able to fully exercise your lungs.  So now you're drowning in your own fluid, frequently shitting yourself, tied to a bed, with a tube stuck down your nose. 
 Eventually your electrolyte balances go off, because we can't feed you well enough and you're shitting yourself nearly constantly. It causes a heart arrhythmia.  Add this in to the rest of the crap you are dealing with. 
 Eventually, this arrhythmia causes your heart to stop. But your spouse tells us to ""do everything"" and we get you back to the land of the living.  Not that you're really living. This happens a few more times over the next few months. 
 Mercifully, after 10 months in hospital, your body quits and your wife finally says it's okay not try to bring you back.

"Alright so I fucked my friends ex gf I known the guy through my dad most of my life he is 35 years old Im pretty good friends with him (im 20) drinking buddies and stuff like that. I know he is pretty liberal with relationships as he and his ex wife where swingers. 
 He started dating this really hot 24 year old for a year they been having lots of pretty bad problems and they broke up. So anyway I was just driving home last saturday and she called me saying shes drunk and no one is going to pick her up so I was like ok Ill get ya cause I felt bad for her so I went and picked her up. I asked her where she wanted to go, and this girls hammered, and she said the mountains. I asked her if she had anywhere else to go as I had no intentions of doing anything with her she said no you can just drop me off there I was like no im not gonna leave you in the mountains by yourself we'll go there till you find somewhere to go. We get up there im drinking some cause I was gonna get a head start on the party I was planing on going to. So we are sitting there I was like do have any idea on where your needing to go and she said no hang on and shes txting someone and then just out of now where she asks ""do you want to fuck?"" I was shocked and being about half drunk at the time I said ""uhhhhhhh yea I kinda do"" so we did it and now I feel really bad, but still she had no where to go I had no idea where to take her. She says just take me to your house and at this point Im really tired my self and thinking ok what the hell and Im figuring my dad isnt going to be there seeing as hes always out drinking on Saturdays.

"Well reddit, I fucked up pretty bad. Admittedly, it was last night actually. I bought acid from a dealer who I had previously bought from and decided to take it that night. My parents were home but I thought I could handle it without them noticing, considering I've taken it before and had not any adverse reaction to it. With actual LSD, I am calm and generally just enjoy the feeling and am chill. As soon as I put the blotter in my mouth, I knew something was different. It had a taste, which if you've done acid before, you know it shouldn't. It was a bitter taste, but I decided fuck it. Thirty minutes later I started to feel nauseous and generally like shit. I started freaking out, which only made it worse. I called my best friend to come over so my parents wouldn't come to my room and told her to hurry. I then proceeded to throw up and felt absolutely terrible, all the while seeing lights and hallucinating, or experiencing the world in a different way, and having my motor skills extremely impaired, kinda like when you're really drunk. My mother actually came at one point to ask when my friend was coming and I had to feign sleepiness to somewhat explain my slurred speech and thankfully she did not question it, most likely because she did not get a good look at me with the lights off and my face hidden by my covers. When my friend got here, I looked and felt like death. My eyes were as swollen and as red as the devil's dick. We proceeded to watch How I Met Your Mother and she had to put the show on for me because I could not function whatsoever. Thankfully, the gross feeling passed after an hour or so and I actually enjoyed the trip. After about two and a half hours I was able to function somewhat normally, while still tripping pretty hard. From reading other drug experiences, I figured my dealer must have sold me 25i thinking it was LSD. The trip, or at least the most intense part, only lasted around five hours which further makes me think it was 25i. So yeah, I'm not buying from him anymore and if I do ever buy LSD again I am making sure to test it before anything.",2101,I dropped what I thought was acid when it wasn't and tripped major balls while hiding it from my parents.,105,0.9595409035682678,0.0195981673896312,0.0475478582084178,0.0001929004210978,0.941931962966919,0.0023457009810954,0.0048085362650454,0.0001666092284722,0.1860933005809784,0.0008056462975218,0.0049127102829515,0.0002128388150595,"""I bought acid from a dealer who I had previously bought from and decided to take it that night"" ""As soon as I put the blotter in my mouth, I knew something was different.

"I woke up one morning to my gf being extra affectionate. I decided that because she was naked (I was naked too, probably what attracted her to me that morning), she had earned rightful access to my plethora of sexual talents to use for her own pleasure. 
 Sex commences. About 20 minutes in, I'm getting close. Shit, wait, sorry, back up a bit. I get really bad leg cramps in the morning about 20% of the time. Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, sex. So I tell her I'm gona cum and she moans ""No no I'm almost there...keep going!!!"" My eyes lit up...because I had never made her orgasm from penetrative sex!! We go for another 2 minutes or so and she starts to moan louder and harder than ever. I did it! I have a MagiCock! I'm the motherfuckin master!!! UUUUUHHHHHHHHH-leg cramp. 
 She's in the middle of her orgasm and I was just at the start of my own, and my leg decides now is the best time, in its very busy schedule, to get a cramp out of the way. When I get these cramps...I don't yell. I don't shriek. I don't scream. I. Fucking.  ROAR!!!!!!  My dick did not get the message in time, so I had already started cumming when the first wave of searing pain lashed its way up and down my leg. I slammed my hand against the bed and clasped my fingers around a pillow to hold on to for dear life. I  ROAR  louder than I ever had. The pain definitely had an exponent or two over the orgasm, but I still felt both somehow. 
 When the nightmare of an orgasm was over, I pulled out and rolled around on the bed in agonizing pain. This was when my gf first realized something was wrong. I wimpered ""l-l-leg cc-c-cr-cramp"" and she backed off...there was nothing she could do until the final wave passed. 
 Tears rolling down my face, I finally recover and sit up to face my gf. She tells me ""Well, umm...I feel a little bad saying this since you probably don't agree...but that was the best sex I've ever had."" I immediately forgot about my pain and had the biggest smile on my face for weeks.

"So I was waiting for a bus for work today. All of the sudden I hear a commotion and see an old man loudly arguing with a younger guy (early 20s). The younger guy leaves, yelling profanities, and as he's walking across the bus station he, without any provocation, slaps a girl in the face and hits an older woman in the back of her head, still loudly ranting. They haven't even said a word to him before that (of after, for that matter). 
 First thing that came to mind was that he was either drunk or high. His pronunciation was fine, there was no slurring or any other speech defect usually seen in mentally challenged. 
 So, as he just hit the lady right in front of me, I loudly say ""Hey!"", and as soon as I've said it, he turns to me, comes close up in my face, yelling something along the lines of ""WHAT DO  YOU  WANT MOTHERFUCKER! FUCKING COCKSUCKER!"" and such, with no intention of stopping. 
 As he was getting closer up in my face, in a split second I just swing. In the last moment, however, I decide to slap him, instead of punching him (don't know why, really). But I slapped him really hard, pretty much as hard as I could. 
 He dropped down on his ass, oblivious about what had just happened. He just sat there for a few seconds (in shock, I guess) and then the screaming and crying started. That was a cry of a 10 year old child. He was rocking front to back, tears in his eyes, screaming ""HE HIT ME! MOTHERFUCKING COCKSUCKER! HE HIT MEEEE!"". As it started to dawn on me that he's mentally retarded, my bus came to the station, so I quickly got on it and went away. 
 When I analyzed this with myself afterwards, I rationally came to the conclusion that I did nothing wrong. I honestly thought that he was going to hit me next. But still, every time it comes to me, I feel bad. I don't know if would have done anything different if I knew of his disability before he came up to me. 
 So Reddit, have you ever encountered a violent mentally challenged person and what did you do? Are there here any trained professionals that have any advice on how to handle these type of situations/people?",2105,"Deservedly hit a mentally challenged guy, don't know if that was the way to go

"Throw away for obvious reasons 
 So today I(m) fucked up pretty badly. This just happened as I woke up less than an hour ago. MY parents went out of the province this weekend, leaving the house to just my little brother and I. Last night, after he went to sleep, I took the opportunity to engage in some self love. Now, I'm a bit of a size queen. I have a bag full of toys, all of them much larger than your standard dildo and enough to make almost any one recoil in fear. While I played with myself, I got pretty drunk and smoked enough to get me pretty loopy. By the time I was done, half a dozen toys were strewn around our cold cellar and a thin film of lube covered most of the surfaces. With my ass lips sagging and my shame in full display for anyone that looked inside, I stumbled up to my room to get changed but unfortunautely I collapsed on my bed. Promising myself just a few minutes of rest, I let my eyes close and the next thing I knew it was morning. 
 Now, the thing you have to remember is that my dildos are pretty big, the largest [being thicker]( than [my forearm]( and I left them just lying there. I stumbled down the stairs trying to remember what happened when I hear the sounds of my little brother playing video games coming from the basement. Panic struck me as I hoped that he didn't see anything. I looked into my room of debauchery and saw that everything had been put away. My mind reeled, wondering if my parents had come home early. I ran back up the stairs to see the driveway empty and the horrible realization dawned on me. I asked my brother ""Di-did you clean up in there."" He just turned to me with tear-filled eyes and said ""You're sick [bigtoyaddict]. What the fuck is wrong with you?"" Then he started crying. I hugged him, apologizing profusely and thanking him for what he did. You see, I'm not on the best terms with my parents and he thought if they found my mess they'd finally kick me out, which is probably true. I just finished cleaning up the last of the lube and now I'm sitting here wondering if my brother will ever be able to look me in the eyes again.",2106,Left out my really big sex toys and my brother cleaned up for me,64,0.9540071487426758,0.6208111047744751,0.0313132889568805,0.0048222648911178,0.904476284980774,0.3480760455131531,0.0049762264825403,0.0011196571867913,0.2210667580366134,0.0089063057675957,0.0043706907890737,0.0010047011310234,"My parents went out of the province this weekend, leaving the house to just my little brother and I.

"This fuckup wasn't exactly today but has been occurring for the past week. So I'm a nerdy college student, and for the summer I work as a waiter at a local resort. The staff here tends to party a lot after hours with the guests. 
 The past week I had a table of girls around my age. Now last Wednesday, the other waiters and I were at the resort after hours celebrating a couple friends; birthdays who also worked in the kitchen. While we were celebrating we ran into a couple of our tables partying as well. 
 We are all around the same age, so we started to party together playing drinking games. All through out the night I was talking and flirting with this one girl from my table who we will call Sam. And yes if you saw my username, my name is Sam as well. I was pretty drunk at this point, but I could hold a decent conversation. As it turned out, Sam is also secretly very nerdy. We ended up making physics jokes as we were playing beer pong. She started talking about other science related things. 
 Things were going well, and I started to like this girl, but in my drunken state I couldn't tell if she was flirting back or not. Around 1:30 even though the party was still going on, I decide that I need to go back home since I'm 18 and my parents would kill me if I didn't come back home. I came home and didn't really think much of any flirting that happened that night. 
 Well the next two days pass ( Thursday and Friday). I had these two days off, so I really didn't interact with anyone at work as its my brother's birthday, and I had a lot of family over. Friday night, I get this text from my coworker saying that I really should come down and party with them. He tells me that Sam talked to him and had a crush on me. Now I would have gone down there in a heartbeat, but the only problem is because its my brother's birthday there was absolutely no way to sneak out of the house to meet up with Sam. The one girl I meet that is actually nerdy and into me, and there was absolutely nothing I could do to leave.

"About a month ago, my ex left me, and I was devastated, I posted here for help. I know what I want now, and I am trying my hardest to win her back. We met up last night, and I asked her if we could try again, and she said she needed time to think. I sent her the following message, and I'd like you guys' opinion on it, and my situation. Here's the message: 
""I dont want to rush you, or affect your answer. This waiting is killing me. I know you've got a lot to think about, and I know its going to take time. My chest is killing me, I just want to know so bad. I wanna know what you're thinking. I know you don't know. I know its gunna take time and you're busy, and you dont need to be bothered by my incessant questions. But know that I love you. So much. And I want this. And if you say yes, I promise you, I will fight every day to make you happy. To keep us talking, about everything. Youre the only one I want Cecilia. That's the way it has been for the longest time. Youre all I can picture. Youre amazing, so beautiful, brilliant... I know I didn't say it too much, but you are. So beautiful, I did and still do cherish you. You are priceless to me, invaluable. I want to make you happy, I want to be the one to make you happy again. I want to wake up to you, as often as we can. I want to watch sunsets and rises with you. I want to walk with you, enjoy life with you. I want to be able to hug and kiss you, and hold you when its rough, I want to be the one you go to when shit hits the fan. I want to be the one, who is always there. The one constant for you in this life of change. I want us. The way we were supposed to be. They said we wouldn't last 2 months back in high school. I wanna show them how fucking strong we are. I wanna do this, and fucking do it right. I wanna be open, and loving, and I wanna remember this hellish pain, so that I never hurt you again. So I never put you through this hell again. I've learned from my mistake. The mistake that cost me the woman I love more than anything in this world. I wanna rectify that. Let me rectify it.""

"Not sure if this fits, but here goes: 
 I met a girl, Alice, at a bar one night hangin out with some friends. we really hit it off, exchanged numbers and the whole bit. A day or so later she calls me and we make plans to go out. Dinner, drinks, Jazz club, great night loads of fun, back to her place for a night cap. I end up spending the night. 
 The following morning she wakes up early has to be 6 or 7, tells me that she has to go to work but that I can stay, just lock the door on my way out. 
 I put my head back down on the pillow for what feels like a millisecond, open my eyes and see someone outside of her bedroom. I assume it's her (I wear glasses, but wasn't wearing them at the time). I sit up in bed, the person notices me and says, ""Who the fuck are you!?"" in a deep manly voice. 
 ""I'm a friend of Alice's."" I explained 
 ""Yeah, I can see that. Did she tell you she was married?!"" 
 I'm pretty much stunned at this point, I don't really know what to do, because she hadn't told me she was married. So I get up out of what I can only assume is this guys bed (by the way, I'm also stark naked) and get ready to leave. 
 ""I guess she also didn't tell you that she has a kid."" he said as I pulled my pants over my ass. 
 ""no she didn't tell me anything like that."" I replied sheepishly, and scared to death at this point because every moment I was there i could see his face turning shades of red. 
 ""well she ruined my life, you should stay away from her ..."" he said as he picked up the 13"" television from the TV stand and started for the door 
 ""Don't take the TV man, she's gonna think I stole it."" Oh why did I say that??? 
 ""I don't give a fuck what she thinks! Yesterday she told me she wanted to get back together and that I shouldn't file for divorce. Where the fuck do you think I'm headed now?"" and with that he left, TV in hand. 
 Alice called me later and I told her what happened (making sure that I told her I didn't steal her TV), I didn't see her again after that cause I felt pretty scuzzy and I think she felt really embarrassed. 
 They were separated at the time, but that was a real shitty feeling.",2133,woke up after a one night stand to the girls husband telling me how awful she is.,81,0.7504512071609497,0.3054951727390289,0.013462777249515,0.0003737478691618,0.7594999670982361,0.0077793509699404,0.0039946567267179,0.0002827340504154,0.1147225722670555,0.0318172238767147,0.0057202009484171,0.0009491787059232,"""I met a girl, Alice, at a bar one night hangin out with some friends.

"Was at a bar one night a few months back talking with my friend who is the tender.  I sit down next to a guy who makes a joke, we laugh, all is well.  After about 3 total minutes sitting next to him, the guy says to me in a confidential tone ""Hey I gotta tell you man...you've gotta get the fuck out of here.""  Looking confused as fuck, I ask ""Why?  I just got here...""  He proceeds with ""Dude you gotta get your girl and get the fuck out of here...they're gonna kill you tonight!""  I ask him, ""Who is gonna kill me?  What for?"" and he replies with a glance to the side and a curt wag of his finger in the direction of the bartender who I have known for 6 years. 
 About that time I started getting much more suspicious about this whole scenario.  Until this point I thought 'Well, it isn't impossible that someone wants to kill me but I don't see anyone here that I have pissed off before.'  Better to be safe than sorry.  He's got a strange look in his eye, though, and I've been around enough people to know that this is likely drug related, but I am still confused because 3 minutes before everything was normal.  I say to the guy ""Hey - I don't think bubba wants to kill me dude...I tip him pretty well..."" trying to be light-hearted.  ""No dog, you gotta come with me I gotta talk to you...they're gonna kill you man!""  At which point he gets up and walks toward the smoking alley and I tell him ""Yeah man...I'll be right there I just have to get a beer."" 
 As I turn to look back at my friends and the bartender who are all having a conversation, I feel a heavy thud on my cheek - not enough impact to daze me but definitely shocking to the point that it took me at least 10 seconds to realize that this fucking guy actually just hit me.  Only one other person out of 30-40 in the bar at the time saw it but having this whole conversation in my mind and having just gotten hit in the face, I immediately got up and in his face and slammed his ass against a pool table.

"So... I'm really into AA. I love my group, I'm coming up on a month and feeling awesome! I've been reading my Big Book and attending tons of meetings and all in all, life is going excellent. I needed a method of living and AA really gives me that structure. It kind of fills that 'what do I do with myself?' lack of purpose that a lack of religion has always left me with. My answer to that question used to be ""Party! Sex! Alcohol! Anything that feels good!  All the time !! Drink all the alcohol! Do all the drugs! Experience  ALL  the things!! I'm going to wrest pleasure from this life if it  kills  me. It's all about me and getting mine.  Fuck you and yours. "" Now it's simply ""Improve myself and serve others."" Radical, right? 
 Here's the thing, I've jumped into reworking myself with both feet! I found a sponsor who is  so me ! Well... an aspect of me. (I'm starting to understand the lunacy of defining myself in concrete terms. I am not a meme. I'm not this one specific sort of shallow person who dresses just so. I'm a different version of PG every day and that's both normal and awesome.) Anyway, I finished the HW she assigned me as well as taking a few recommendations on worthwhile work from other old timers and completing those as well. Seriously. I see the benefit in this line of study and I'm working it  hard . I'm already a better person. I'm more honest. I'm more productive. I'm less worried about the future. This. Is. Awesome. 
 Here's the thing though: I called my sponsor and let her know I was done with my step one work... no response. No worries. Life is busy. So I sat down and read through the Big Book. All of it. I got a lot out of it, but I really think that I need more guidance. I don't know what to do here. Is there more material I can read? Am I missing a lot of what other people are finding (and thus I should read again, but slower)? I didn't go through all the stories at the end, are there a lot of program details in there (I read some of them, but I already know I'm an alcoholic. I don't need to be convinced.) Am I missing something? Do I possibly need a new sponsor? Is educated guidance what I'm missing?",2159,I want more!!

"Bro cut contact with her. I'm gonna be really straight forward with everythintpg I say. She isn't in to you, and theres a 99.9999% chance it's going to stay that was. You're not going to be able to ""talk her into liking you"", and your lack of confidence is not going to get any better even if you were able to talk her into it. Instead of always wondering why she's not into you or reciprocating your feelings, you're going to be wondering why she  is  into you and why she  is  reciprocating your feelings. Any little hiccup or moment out of place while your together is just going to result in paranoia. You'll start reading her texts, checking her Facebook messages, and asking who it is when her phone rings. Sorry but you're screwed either way when it comes to that girl. 
 And if this kid knows you're into this girl, and he's going right ahead and doing all this shit right in front of you anyways, then fuck him with a dirty needle that has been in 40 junkies arms. That kid isnt your fucking friend. I mean, Jesus Christ, he doesn't even have the courtesy to at least do all that behind your back. And honestly, that girl isn't your friend either dude, as if that needed to be said after everything I mentioned in the first paragraph. 
 I dont know if these people are your only friends but if they're not, then do you really need them? The answer to that question is 'no' by-the-way. Cut those 2 mother fuckers off from your connect. The dude is a fucking prick and the girl simply just isn't in to you for whatever reason. I'm not telling you to just ""get over it"". Cause we both know that getting over someone whom you have feelings for is NEVER that simple. But discontinue contact with them and start hanging out with other people, even if they're not into opiates like you are. 
 Finally, if you live in Chicago call me. I found 60 bags and a little over $1400 cash yesterday on the ground. I'll throw you a bag and I'll be your friend.

"I work at a large pharmacy retail chain in the US, one day I was playing cashier waiting for the next shift that was running a little late, this ""lady"" comes in and says she has a refund. 
 Me: ""Ok, ma'am do you have your receipt for the item?"" 
 Her: ""This is bullshit, I don't need a fucking receipt."" 
 (after 10 years in retail one thing I will never tolerate is having a customer talk like that in front of other customers or to any of my employees, including myself) 
 Me: ""I am sorry but I will have to have a receipt for this item since it is an item we don't sell at this location."" 
 Her: ""That is just a fucking lie I bought this here a few days ago."" 
 (I check our item history to reveal we have no sales history, and the item is not active. I then share this information with the ""lady"".) 
 Her: Well I am not leaving here until you idiots give me my fucking money."" 
 At this point I turn in to a robot that can only say please leave my store. As I am repeatedly asking her to please leave, she is releasing a continuous string of obscenities directed at me. Basically, calling me everything but my name. 
 After about 30-40 seconds of this the deputy that has been standing behind her for the whole time speaks up, ""He has already asked you about 7 times."" 
 This does nothing more than focus her rage on him, and before she even realizes that she is about to come face to chest with a 6'2"" Sheriff Deputy, she spins and says ""why don't you mind your own fucking business?"" 
 The deputy then leans down about an inch from her face and yells ""Just who the fuck do you think you are talking to?"" 
 To this she immediately turns to exit the store with the deputy on her heels. There is another exchange between the two that was just out of ear shot. But it ends up with the deputy with the goon hand on her upper arm, forcibly removing her from the store.

 On with the story! 
 So my sister just recently announced she's pregnant about 5 months after having her first kid, to the surprise of the whole family she wasn't nervous at all. Due to the fact she is on every single benefit provided by this shitty government she could afford an I-phone, designer clothes, a fucking mac laptop and all that shit. 
 She is basically white trash. 
 So she wanted me to attend her baby shower this past Saturday but I said no. Why? Because all her shitty friends were there. So of course in her white girl wanting to black attitude, she goes to facebook to rant. 
 Actual expert from her page: 
 ""When u thinking u can trust them then turning their back on u bc you arent a skinny thin bitch like them"" 
 Did I mention that her friends are hams too? 
 Anywho, this morning i got a text from my brother saying that Melanie is coming over to ""teach me a lesson"" 
 Let me play you the song of my people... 
 > If theres something strange.. 
 > In your neighborhood... 
 > Who you gonna call? 
 > MY MOTHER! 
 So my mother being mama bear comes on over, now let me tell you a thing or two about her. 
 She moved back from Scotland to America with my siblings and father when I was about 3, so she could serve again in the national guard. Serving during the L.A riots, not someone you want to fight with. 
 Anywho, back to the story. 
 So my mother arrives, Melanie is a no-show.

"Not sure if it belongs here, offmychest or any other /r/ , but I felt it is most suitable here. 
 I started working at this place when I was 15. I worked graveyard shifts for the passed 2 years. Sometimes I work during the day while I do night shifts because they ask me. I'm the type of person not to leave someone hanging or says ""no"" when they need help, so I always say ""yes"". They know that and abuse my willingness to help. I think its one of the best qualities in being human in this sort of society. That is my weakness and my strength. 
 There is no gauge to weigh my deep seeded resentment towards night shifts. I got off it by pestering the boss and went back to school again. I had a short semester. 
 I've been off Graveyard Shifts (GS) from January to Septemeber. I asked my boss in July what sort of procedure would I need to move up the ladder in the company because a co-worker of mine was going on a 6 week vacation in October and I would be one of the best candidates to fill in the position. He laid down the information of the whole process and told me he'd give me an answer at the end of August. I push for the boss to start training me now since its September. Next thing I know I'm getting a phone call coming in to work GS again with 2 hours notice, in September. I head in with no sleep.  I fucking hate it. 
 Time passes and Its October. They bring in another person from another branch of the company to replace the co-worker on vacation. I pester the boss to push me forward or at least take me off. He says,"" I can't do that right now, its a busy month."" 
 At this point my blood is boiling,I asked "" when will I get off then?"" 
 He says, "" not until after December"" 
 I blurt out in an angry fit, "" So you never intended for me to move up? You've been lying straight to my face for 3 fucking months? This is a god damn fucking insult!"" 
 His rebuttal, "" Its not an insult"" 
 Mine, "" ITS A FUCKING INSULT TO ME!!! 5 YEARS AND THIS IS HOW I'M TREATED?!? YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE FUCKING 5 YEARS!!! ""

"My girlfriend and I were both at a party last night. It got to a point in the night where I probably hadn’t seen her for about an hour. I wasn’t that worried – I had been talking to my friends and was more concerned that maybe she would be pissed I had been ignoring her. I went to go look for her and as soon as I found her she put her hands over her neck like she was covering something. I asked her what the fuck she was doing and she was like  Marco did it, I tried to push him off but I couldn’t . She moved her hands and she had this giant fucking hickey on her neck. Marco is this gay dude who she is like best friends with and who I tolerate. This might make me sound like a dick but he is just too flamboyant and over the top for me. 
 I went go find him because I wanted to know for sure but my gf told me he had left because she had got pissed at him. Maybe I was over reacting, I was drunk, but I didn’t know what to believe and I was mad that she had let this happen. I didn’t want to cause an even bigger scene so after arguing a bit I just left. My girlfriend was calling and texting me all night but I didn’t know what to say. I had all these cheating scenarios going round my head and I just didn’t want to talk to her. 
 So I’ve calmed down and sobered up a bit this morning but I don’t really know what to do next. I know I should probably talk to my girlfriend but it is fucking hard for me to see her with that on her neck. Thinking about it more it is possible it was Marco because he is the type of gay guy who dances and makes out with girls but I still don’t know if I buy that she couldn’t stop him – he is not exactly a big guy. I know it doesn't take long to give a hickey but it is a big one. To me it doesn’t make any difference if it was a gay guy or a straight guy. If she let any man do this I think it crossed a line but I guess she could be telling the truth. 
 I just really don’t how the fuck to deal with this or what to say to her. I guess I am just going to have to decide whether I believe her or not. I could talk to Marco but he is like her best friend so I’m sure he will support her whatever. Any advice on what to say or do next? I can’t even really think straight right now.",2221,"My girlfriend got a hickey from someone at a party. She claims it was her gay friend and she ""couldn't stop him"".

"Throw away, for obvious reasons. 
 Let's begin with that I have known him for a little over 6 years, moved across country to be with him (so basically, I'm alone) got knocked up within a few months of being here and I decided to keep our son. Let me tell you all now, my son is the lighthouse of my life. 
 I knew before coming into this he has dated both sexes in the past, and to quite frank, I don't care. He was always really vague about the details, but I never wanted to ask. 
 I was crawling through the closet looking for some of my things five days ago and had found a girl kit. Wig, fake tits, the whole she-bang. Now, I don't mind at all if this is who he is - and I am accepting to that. I felt awful - because I know it's hard for transexuals to accept who they are & to come out and be themselves. I love him, and I want him to be happy. 
 But when I was going through our laptop, I found that he was responding to M/F/T ads on craigslist in towns several hours out of ours. 
 I'm fucking devastated. I confronted him after finding his kit, but I didn't bring up the CL stuff I found. I told him I found the kit, and I just want to know the truth & whatever it is, we can work through it and I would be more than happy to help him find who he is. 
 He denied everything. Said that he can like one of the other ""sexes"" without desiring the other. And that its something he used to do in the past and not anymore. I, again, am devastated, for obvious reasons. 
 I haven't told anyone. I'm alone, 1000 miles away from home. He's been incredibly nice since then, been up my ass more than usual, but whatever. 
 I'm depressed. And it's not PP, I love my son more than anything on this planet and he is the only thing keeping me going. 
 What the fuck do I do? I'm lost, I'm sinking into a hole. A friend offered to fly me back home for the weekend (I got laid off monday, shits been rough anyways so shes aware of that) but I bet he wouldn't be okay with it. He gets all fucking paranoid if i get phone calls from friends or decide to actually go out (which I havent in months.) 
 I feel like I'm being torn into a million pieces. I don't know how to further talk to him. I've no energy to get angry, I just want to know the truth.",2240,"Found out my SO has been seeking sexual partners on craigslist, betrayed and tired of this shit.

"We didn't really hit it off but she did seem interested in me. Why the fuck is this shit so hard? Why can't people just fuck like fucking gorillas?? 
 Dude, she probably was interested. I've never had a Tinder date not end in sex if I made any sort of effort at all. Even if we didn't connect at all, just kind of talked without ""clicking"" or even flirting much, etc. 
 In my experience, girls on Tinder are probably looking to get laid, but they're on Tinder which means they are probably shy or weird or something. Just come up with any lame excuse to bring her back to your place, and then make a physical move. This has worked for me 3/3 times and one of the girls ended up as a FWB for a few months. 
 In that case, I met her at a bar with her fat sister, we played a board game and I sat next to her and did some horrible non-smooth kino that she didn't reject, and after an awkward hour or two, I invited her to come see my dog at home. I was living with my parents at the time. We went to the basement and played Mariokart for a few races, and then after one ended I kind of awkwardly just leaned in. She didn't seem super receptive, like backed away slightly, so I said. ""Huh, you seem like you're being evasive. Is something wrong?"" She replied with ""That's just kinda how I am"", to which I said ""Well... I guess I'll just have to push through it thennn?"" 
 Then we banged and ended up banging weekly for the next couple of months and becoming decent friends. I had another Tinder ""date"" where the girl drunk drove to my friends' apartment late one night. One of my friends was on a vacation so I was staying in his room to get away from the parents for a few days. Anyway, that was the most uncomfortable weird meetup ever. We sat across from each other at a tall kitchen table and she kind of rambled on about people I had never met and complained about school and stuff. Basically, acted like an annoying girl. Then eventually it got to be like 3am, and I was like ""well... I'm pretty exhausted, are you?"" and she said yeah. Then I let her know she was welcome to stay but ""there's really only this one bed to share"". So we got in bed and then I started hooking up with her and we had sex.

 Alright, seriously...cut out the personal offense crap. It's disturbingly paranoid. Just because someone is late, it's not because YOU aren't worth it. It's not some weird passive-aggressive personal jab. Maybe got up late. Got caught up in some daydreams? Coffee took longer than I thought to make? The area I'm walking to isn't so close as thought? 
 I can say for myself, estimating time, weight, distance, age (just a sidenote..sort of a function of time :) ) is incredibly difficult. So...drop the job interview level of importance and just tell me where YOU will be from say, 6ish to 6:30? 
 Why? So  I  can get to  YOU  and accommodate wherever YOU happen to be. I'm sorry...how is that selfish? 
 What is it with you people and punctuality? Why is it so important? Is your life so horrible you can't be left alone with your own thoughts for 5 to 10 minutes? Do you pretend we live in a perfect world where everything runs on clockwork...because we don't.

 What irks me about this is the value system. Some people here...fuck. These are people you call your FRIENDS. And...because of...300 - 600 fucking seconds...you're going to abandon them. And then in some cases, actually shit-talk them behind their back? And still pretend you have some kind of moral superiority there?

Sounds very similar to my story although different time frames of weights. <Here is my summarized story if your interested + my appreciation @ the end> At my max I was over 340 pounds (I don't know how much I rly weighed cause the only scale I had capped at 340 pounds, xD) I just turned 20 years old and sitting at 220 pounds right now (So much extra skin. . . its such a self conscience thing, but indeed profoundly better than being a fat-ass) I had gone real hard on myself in bursts of a few months, fasting and counting calories and working out for hours, but these bursts all lasted 4 months or so at a time with gaining / no change, I would say due to school and other excuses, but really all to induldge those taste buds. I stayed stagnant and had gained weight since my last relapse from life-change, and what brought me back was the summer weather coming out and having my shirt off standing next to all my friends that have 4-6pack abs making me realize what I truly desire.

Before I'd lose it! I just want to thank you for sharing your story and being the top post. . it was exactly what I needed as it felt so relatable. Thanks for being so successful and for the amount of pictures . .  . I know now what my skin will prolly look like when I get down to 185ish, which is my current goal!

"Here's one I've mentioned before: 
 I had to go to a physical or something in the afternoon, when I was in community college. I can't remember what it was all about. Health insurance or something. Anyways, I spent the morning shooting pool in the game room with my friends and girlfriend at the time. 
 I convinced my gf to give me a handjob in the bathroom before I left for the clinic. There's a handicap bathroom that locks that I use to use. So, we're in there and she starts rubbing me off. I started getting uncomfortable because it was so dry, so I told her to spit on her hand or something. 
 ""No, that's gross."" Fine, so use the soap, I suggest. She does this and it's weird. It takes way longer then it should of because it was one of those, ""are you done yet?"" kinda handjobs. By the time I finished, I had to zip up and run out to my car to make it to the clinic on time. 
 A bit later, I'm sitting on the paper sheet, after the nurse showed me to the exam room and left. That's when it hits me. Someone is going to be face first in my crotch. I take a quick peak and sure enough... The fucking handsoap mixed with my sweat and crotch dampness and is slimy and semi-lathered. There's goo all over my boxers and shlong. It looks like I got a bj from a camel, only it reeks like soap. 
 I pull my pants up and the nurse or doctor who is going to do the exam walks in. I'm sweating bullets as I answer their inane questions, knowing where this is going. Finally, the moment of truth and they ask me to pull down my pants. 
 ""Uh... so, I just want to say that my  girlfriend  gave me a hand job before I came here.. and well...  she  used hand soap and I didn't have a chance to shower so all the stuff you see is just soap."" Oh shit, I bet that sounded fucking pathetic. Yeah, right, your ""girlfriend"". Fucking pervert. 
 In a totally monotone voice they just said, ""Okay."" That's it. So I pulled 'em down and they started poking around for whatever. I could feel the skin stick to everything as the junk got tossed around. I didn't look down. I stared at the knot designs on the wooden door. They always looked like eyes to me. Always watching me as I shit in the bathroom. Seeing all my shame. God, I was so down.

"Hello everyone. My ""roommate"" is a subletter that moved in January with her dog and since then has been nothing but a hassle. It all started with her dog constantly defecating and urinating in my room. When I broached the subject with her in January she said she would keep her dog kenneled but she hasn't. She has been generally unclean. The bathroom is a mess, the kitchen is filled with her dirty dishes and mine, until I washed them and packed them away. (I stopped living at my house and staying at my boyfriend's house because of her behavior). About 2 weeks ago she verbally accosted me calling me all sorts of obscenities and then lashing out in anger and kicking the stove. Her boyfriend had to physically remove her from the house because of how she was behaving. Then this past Monday she came up to me again while I was packing more of my stuff away and I told her ""Do not talk to me"" and she went off on another yelling match calling me names again, shoved me, and splashed a pitcher of warm soapy water on my back while I was carrying my things out of the door and all over the kitchen floor and then attempted to throw my large area rug at me. She has a history of violent behavior, she is on deferment for battery and I've contacted my landlord and filed a police report against her. She even had her mom call and harass me on the phone. My landlord just emailed me and informed us that he wants to have a sit down so we can figure out a solution for the next 4 months. Is there  any  way I can use her violent and abusive tendencies to get out of my lease? My landlord is under the impression that this is a fixable problem and doesn't seem to realize that I have no intention to continue living with an unemployed unstable individual. She also told me in her rage-fueled tirade that she would not be paying me the money she owed me for the utilities and she actually hasn't at all since moving in (I haven't even asked her for the money, this is something that she just said ""Fuck you, and I'm not going to pay you your money"" verbatim).

"Side note. This was kind of an accident, because I'm a dumb fucking kid. Please read before you judge my choices. Also I couldn't find another sub to post on but it has a nice message 
 Midnight and I got home. Girlfriend promised we would hang but cancels as I'm getting to her place. 20 minute ride home it is. I'm not a suicidal person at all, but I was so fed up. I had been fighting with her all day and she had me crazy. I was also sad about some other significant events that happened during the summer. To be honest I'm actually not suicidal at all. I have good grades, many friends and love life. Put this night my SO had me over the tipping point. I was fucking livid 
 12:10 I'm furious and have a massive headache, I'm grinding my teeth. I take 2 Advil because I can't fall asleep with a headache like this. 
 12:30 ugh I still feel like shit. I pop one of my dad's Prozac. Take a swig or two of Sangria. 
 12:35 eh one more Prozac can't hurt. I'll take a couple of swigs too. After all the bottle says Alcohol will make me more drowsy this can't be bad. 
 12:45 at this point I text my friend because I realize that this might not be the best idea. ""Hey man I did  blah blah blah , telling you just in case something happens."" Here comes the plethora of info on alcohol and painkillers and I FREAK. THE FUCK. OUT. Next thing you know I'm crying trying to puke out these pills but it's not working. I'm calling poison control and they say I'll be fine, just stop drinking, oh no he wants to talk to Dad. He hears everything and it's nighttime so I still await my punishment. At this point I assume I'll be okay but I'm trying not to fall asleep, just in case. 
 To anyone trying to kill themselves: don't do it man. Seriously. I've been chased by gun wielding thugs and this whole incident has been the scariest moment of my life. Think about how you'll feel after you do it. Good? Hell no. You'll try and do everything possible. Thankfully I had my parents in the house and I was smart enough to not drink more. You do this same shit and there might not be a going back. Maybe you can't puke it out. Like me. You'll start feeling dizzy. Like me. And then you pass out, swallow your tongue and fucking die.

"I'll put my 2 cents in on this one. (My opinion here, don't get offended please) 
 It's a big part of nature and the environment that we grow up in. For the most part a lot of us are raised in urban areas and see a lot more shit throughout our early lives. A good half of us live in single parent homes (mostly mothers from my experience), and those single parents are working all the time in order for you to live properly. 
 So you're raised by the family that you make, your friends, your environment. The rap culture, drugs, and all the other bullshit is money. Money. And let's all be honest here, drugs and rapping make a lot more money than working the regular 9 to 5 will ever make. So to double up on electrolemon's point - it's a point where you say ""Hey, I'm in this low down neighborhood but wait a minute, Tom over there is making millions just sitting back selling folks stuff they're going to buy anyways! Hey! That song on the radio makes NO FUCKING SENSE but EVERYONE is banging it out their radios and that rapper is making money. I gotta get me some of that."" so it comes down to doing whatever it takes to make money. 
 I grew up around a lot of different types of people so I see things a bit differently than some might. For example, my first girlfriend is currently in jail serving for drug possession and prostitution. One of my closest friends was shot down a few months after leaving the gang life and drug game - We have not found the killer, and his mother is raising his son. Another friend is still in the game. 
 On the other hand, I have a friend who works for a rather large company and is very successful. And myself, who works for a fortune 500 company, has an BS in Networking and an MBA in Information Security. I don't sag my pants (tried it once, couldn't figure out how the fuck you walk), I'm not loud, and all of the other things that people clamp in with the 'black' race. 
 What's the difference between all of us though? Environment and parent involvement. Leaving your children alone in a place that no one with a sane mind wants to be leads them to want to grasp the world in their hands in the quickest way possible. Teaching your children helps them grow and gets them into better things. 
 But that's everyone right?",2266,"Everyone can fit the 'black' stereotype, it all just depends on how you're raised.",82,0.6624674201011658,0.0185364820063114,0.0164471361786127,0.0002725802187342,0.600559651851654,0.0005736081511713,0.0063488287851214,0.0003430575598031,0.2349617928266525,0.0010428875684738,0.05079335719347,0.0041692997328937,"A good half of us live in single parent homes (mostly mothers from my experience), and those single parents are working all the time in order for you to live properly.

"Hey guys 
 Me and my girlfriend have been going out for a year now. She is my first real girlfriend and I love her. We've had sex countless times and have a healthy relationship sewn together with trust. Or so I though. 
 We went to a party yesterday celebrating a friend's birthday. Was a fun, alcohol induced night with around 30~ people. Around 12am, I had to go. Mum was busting my nuts, and i was pretty much 100% sober at that point. But my girlfriend along with 20ish other people decided to sleepover. Honestly I didnt think much of it. When I left her at 12, she was 100% sobered up, abit worn out, and just lying on one of the mattress's she was gonna sleep on. 
 Now comes the bullshit. Apparently some guy who I dont really know, yet goes to my school lay down next to her and started to cuddle. A few of my close friends 100% confirmed this, and I trust them that they wouldn't lie. 
 When we were talking about it, she said the after sleepover part sucked because I wasn't there, it was terrible, blah blah blah. But she was cuddling with this guy. Supposedly, her words, ""it was literally for a minute and he was just lying there! Nothing happened!"" If that's so, I dont get why she had to to deny the fuck out of it when i confronted her about, eventually telling me about it after I told her multiple people saw her. My friends also told me that she was telling people to not tell me bc itll piss me off. Why go through all that if nothing really happened? 
 Im really pissed off with her. I honestly think it's worse how she just lied to me upfront loads of times, instead of just telling something did happened. I thought we had that kind of trust. 
 I just feel really taken advantaged of too. Like, I spend like half my fucking night looking after her bc she was puking at one point. And the second i leave this guy comes and cuddles w her. She says she was to dizzy and tired to push him away, but I know thats horse shit too. 
 The best part? Her friend had to take her to another room to sleep. She didn't even push the guy away herself. Yeah sure when youre tired nothing really matters. But if some random chick got all up on my dick, Id have the respect for my SO to push her off of me. 
 I dont even know if I wanna be with her anymore. Fuck man.",2274,"At party, I left, she slept over, cuddles with another guy, lies about it.

"It was snowing a sleeting like crazy one night when I worked for Domino's and the regional manager refused to close the store. I had a delivery to a well-known ass hole. This guy would order a pizza about once a week and always find something to complain about, so he was constantly getting free pizzas. 
 So after protesting that we should not be driving in the dangerous conditions, I took the run. I slipped and slid all the way to the douche's house and even ran a stop light because my car could not stop on the ice and slid right through it. I finally made it to his house and traversed his shitty walkway, still slipping all over the almost two inches of ice and snow that had accrued over the last few hours, and knocked on the door. 
 The guy answered shirtless and on his cellphone, grabbed his free pizza out of my hand and slammed the door in my face without ever acknowledging I was even there, let alone tipping. I was incensed. I pounded as hard as I could on his door. When he answered I looked him in the eye and yelled, ""Suck my fucking cock, you asshole!"" Then turned around and walked away. 
 He started yelling ""What!? What!?"" and walking after me. His neighbor was a friend of mine and he must have heard the commotion because he was on his front porch when I came to that area, shirtless wonder still following me. My friend asked me, ""Whats up dude?"" I said, ""Your neighbor is an asshole!"" He laughed a little and said ""Oh, yeah"" and walked back inside. 
 I got in my car and drove off with the dude standing in the street, being snowed on, and still on his cell phone. By the time I got back to the store, he had called to complain. The general and assistant managers were laughing and hanging their heads and the regional manager called me into the office. 
 She asked me to repeat what I had said to the customer. I told her, ""You know what I said,"" but she wouldn't give it up. She asked me three more times before I finally said, ""Look, just count my money, I'm the fuck out of here anyway."" She fired me, but it was so worth it. I'd never felt like such a badass and when I walked out of the store I got two hugs and a high five.

"Okay, so I was working on my little novel mocking God in some aspects (like how he screwed up Pi and now we stuck with whole 3.1415 thing).
And I started analysing this system, how sinners go to hell and saints go to paradise. So, from the God's point of view: after your death your fate will be decided on how good of a believer you were. If you were a good guy in God's eyes, you get infinite pleasures at heaven where all your dreams come true.
But if you were a non-believer or chosen a wrong religion, or fucked up too much in your life, you go to hell, where you will be constantly torchured by demons and you will never see the light of day again.
Looks pretty much logical, right? But that's only from God's point of view.
Lets check out other side of that conflict.
There is a Devil, and he desires pain, suffering, he decieves, he is known to be the biggest jerk among faithful people.
As much as God wants for earth to be a great place filled with love, Devil wants for it to be most disgusting place filled with hatred and pain.
And he created his own place for that called hell, to be opposite for heaven. He does whatever he wants in there, burns people alive and etcetera. Not only that, but all the people on earth know that and they dont wanna go there obviously. So they start acting according to their belief, and they do what God tells them to do basicly.
Now, is it me, or this is fucked up, because from this point of view, Devil forces people to behave properly, or he will burn your ass? 
 I mean, Devil exists mainly to force more people to do whats right. Don't you think, that according to that logic, God and Devil are good pals working together on one cause?
If Devil wanted more people in his pleace — hell — he should've offered some pleasures too, maybe guilty pleasures, so people would follow him. And there's 5 main confessions in the world, and according to each of them, only one is true, so naturally Devil gets people from 4 of them, so he is pwning God's ass on the count of souls anyways.
So the fear of Devil maybe driven more people to religion, than love for God. Isn't this false logic for religion? How can 2 opposite guys be working to do one good thing and follow one direction? Is Devil working for God, doing his dirty work for him?",2282,"According to logic in religion (if there is any in it), Devil must be a good guy working with God on one cause and helping him to get more souls into heaven",156,0.7431547045707703,0.0111920861527323,0.0340377911925315,0.0001583555713295,0.6182798743247986,0.0004934288444928,0.0558084361255168,0.0003006298211403,0.3074598908424377,0.00060257432051,0.1042294427752494,0.0006344201392494,"If you were a good person in God's eyes, you get infinite pleasures at heaven.

"So this happened last Friday, which was also the last day of school until break so as normal teenagers, we became excited and rambunctious for the upcoming break and holidays. 
 After school a couple of my friends and I went to sit with a couple of girls, and lucky me, for my crush was sitting in that group of girls. So we all sat and talked about stuff and things and then my crush stood up and randomly said ""Who wants to hear their natural laugh?!"" Confused as fuck, my friends and I said yes. So she started with my friend to the left; basically how this thing works is that you get straddled and put your arms across your chest, and then pretend to laugh. Then the straddler pushes on your chest with a fuckton of force and you start laughing ridiculously... tbh I thought it was really weird but I was curious (and my crush got to straddle me so it was a double win). 
 My turn -- my crush begins to straddle me as she tells me to cross my arms and laugh. I'm feeling pretty good and I'm ready for the next part. Unfortunately, my throat wasn't. The laugh had triggered a cold I'd felt was long gone by then. You see, I'd had been sick for the first three days of the week and I started to recover around Thursday and my cold went from deathly hacks and nose juice calamity to just the occasional small cough, maybe a little sneeze or so.  Anyways, the fake laugh brought some phlegm from my esophagus to my throat, but before I could notify anyone my crush quickly thrusted at my chest with an unexpected force (she's about 100 lbs and 5'3'') that felt like my chest had been crushed by a speeding train made out of legos. Needless to say, that gooey substance from my throat accelerated out of my laughing mouth and my crush square in the cheek. When she felt it she quickly brushed it off her face, gave me a slightly disgusted look and said she had to go to the bathroom, surprisingly calmly. My friends and the girls started to laugh so hard they could have been dying, but I didn't care because I was devoid of any emotion aside from total embarassment. Luckily, the school bus was waiting a few yards away and I quickly grabbed my bag, said a quick have a nice break and ran away.

"So I have been with this girl for four months I am 17 and she is 16. She is sort of a bipolar psychopathic genius prone to drama. the whole time she has been controlling my every action and inaction in the relationship, saying I can't smoke weed, I can't hang with friends she does not approve, I can't criticize her superstitious beliefs or else any of this stuff she will go into a temper tantrum and outcast me; it has gotten so bad that she is the only person I was even talking too. Anyway as I get into the relationship she keeps telling me that she is into ""S&M"". She sends me all these internet links about how to be a more domineering guy. I say that im not that all up for the idea but i will give it a try as we get into the relationship. So here comes valentines day and she decided to dress up in a bunch of black leather and chains and she gives me this bracelet that is apparently suppose to mean that I am dominant. I am generally a pretty chill guy but fuck this is awesome. So im all in the mood and is sitting there playing with her self and telling me she wishes that I would fuck her. I told her that i didn't have a condom and she starts jacking me off. This is something she does reoccurring by the way (she knows im not the most comfortable with that sort of thing) anyway she is enticing me and all giving me blow jobs and stuff so I finally stick my head in her. She yelps all painful like and is all like ""Yeah I like the pain"". Anyway come a week later and she wants to break up with me because I can't talk to her on the phone 5 hours a fucking night.

"Years ago, I got jumped by about 6 teens as I was walking home from the train station. 
 I could tell one of them was the ""leader"" as he stood in front of me, pocket knife in hand; the others were behind him. I had the wall to my back with about 4 feet of space; they never attempted to encircle me, nor would I have allowed it. 
 The leader demanded my wallet; I told him to fuck off and to try and take it. He lunged at me; knife extended in his right hand. I deflected his arm at the forearm and his face met my right elbow that quickly came across. I felt his teeth cave in as I shifted my weight forward into the blow. 
 One other kid moved towards me as Jr was spitting out his teeth on the floor. I had reach on this wiry fuck and his throat was intercepted by my left grip. His face instantly went white. He had no idea that I had my mind on his throat from the moment he stepped forward. I squeeze harder than ever and he gasped for air and squirmed. I delivered a massive right punch square on this kids nose, and it instantly started bleeding buckets. I released at that point, and he fell backwards onto the pavement. 
 The other kids were talking shit, but never helped their friends up - one of which was still writhing on the ground in agony. I was so furious; I charged the remaining four and they bolted. I turned back to junior leader was crying in a pool of his own blood. 
 I said, ""I should kill you right here"" and he begged for mercy. I gave him a powerful kick to the ribs and he lifted off the floor. ""Next time you try to jump someone you will surly die."" 
 I went home, packed a bowl, and watched 5th Element. No shit.

"I fucked up so bad...not because I may have screwed up my goals but because I compromised my virtues. 
 I am a lonely guy who haven't gotten laid in over a year. As a kid, I lacked social skills because all I did was play computer games. When I was 18, I paid a prostitute to take my virginity. Yes, that's how sad of a person I was/am. 
 When I turned 20, I finally got my first girlfriend. She wanted someone older and more experienced so I ""faked it until I made it"". Obviously, the relationship didn't last because of my personal insecurity and inexperience. 
 I am 23 years old today...I just started med school last week and a bunch of new friends decided to hit the city last night to blow off some steam. In our group is this girl who I've been chatting with since the first day. I never made a move on her because she has a long distance relationship. Couple of drinking games in, we played ""never had I ever"" and when someone said he/she had never cheated before, she put one of her fingers down. 
 I wanted to believe I was a man on honor and just took a mental note of it...but as it got progressively later into the night, she would start flirting physically with me until we walked back to our dorm together (since we're the only two that live in a dorm). Our hands collided and we just started holding hands. 
 When we reached our dorms, we said our goodbyes and she goes to her room and I go to mine. In less than 5 minutes, she texts me saying she couldn't sleep. My horny self understood this as probably a booty call and at that moment I wanted to have sex again so bad that I texted her back offering to go keep her company. 
 Got to her room, made small talk before transitioning into making out and sex. Then i made another mistake...I told her I was going to cum and she said she's on birth control so I came inside her. In total, I came inside her twice during our sexcapade. When I asked her again about the birth control, she said ""What? You don't trust me?"" 
 I slinked out her room this morning and feel like the world's biggest douche.

 For the past month my sister has suddenly become a ""social justice warrior"", she's set up a new Tumblr account, and posts social justice warrior memes on it. 
 I triedto be an understanding brother but she said ""Youre not gonna fucking understand being an SJW, its not for dudes anyway, besides you dudes have GMInsideNews and Bloomberg."" 
 Her Tumblr even had some weird requests on it, she wanted a binder, and asked if any Canadian dudes did oral with American dudes, whart was the sex like, also jokes about American-Canadians that could be seen as offensive, questions about gay Canadians' sex lives, and jokes about kd lang. On the tumblr, she even said ""the public have a righttoknwo if a politico is obese."" and even links to big-dick porn sites, plus this comment: 
 > 18 IN ONLY 3 WEEKS!! YOURE GONNA SEE MY POONTANG SOON, GUYS!! 
 Living in the Pacific Northwest, I guess she's been influenced by LGBT writers in nearby Washington, we live in one of the bordering states, not saying where. 
 She spends HOURS on Tumblr, there was even a comment about me on there. It read:

"Not sure if this counts because she was my gf at the time, but here goes. 
 Sophmore year of college. Roommates and I decide to throw a party at our small apartment. This place was a shit hole. Basically four rooms off the living room which was directly connected to the open kitchen area. So we pack the place rather quickly. My gf is having a great time. She usually doesnt drink but that night she decided she wanted to imbibe. Everyone is conversing I happen to be talking to a small group of people in the corner. My gf is next to me. I decide I need to refill my drink and walk off to the fridge. As I am searching for my rum, a blonde girl walks in. She is pretty well known around campus. Mostly because it is a small ass college and she has muscular dystrophy so its not hard to remember her. So Blondie makes a B line for the fridge, or so I thought. As she gets to the fridge she engages me in conversation. At first I am confused because I have never said more than hi to this girl, but she starts asking me about a chick I knew in middle school. Apparently Blondies bf has been cheating on her with one of my middle school classmates. How does Blondie know this? Goddamn facebook. Anyway, Blondie is grilling me about this chick and how I know her and if she is a slut. Now remember what I said about the layout of our apartment. Blondie walked in the front door, which is off the living room, which is directly connected to the kitchen. So my GF watches this chick storm across the party and right up to me. Immediately thinking the worst, my GF stomps up to Blondie grabs her by the hair and begins dragging her out of my apartment. As she is doing this she begins to berate Blondie. After a few insults all the sudden I hear ""YOU ARE A WORTHLESS CRIPPLE CUNT!!"" Silence has now fallen over the entire party. I am cowering in the corner hoping I die a quick and painless death. Blondie crawls off crying. My GF looks back at me from the doorway, gives me the death star and then walks off in the opposite direction.

 Yes, I get that thats pretty heavily armed/ equipped for every day use, but everything except for my combat knives see daily use, and believe you me I don't carry combat knives for no reason. People get scared by how heavily armed I feel comfortable with consistently being, but there is a lot of security and respect that comes from having that always on you and being prepared to use it. Honestly I think that given the scarcity of life and good health it is completely retarded to not be willing and able to do whatever to protect your shit if its called for. I know tweakers who will kill anyone for 50$ of ice, and fuck that man, if it comes down to being armed vs not being armed, err on the side of being ready to protect your own life and those you care about. Its a goddamn shame for decent people to have their lives cut short because of some worthless piece of shit wanted the cash in their wallet for drugs and is willing to do whatever the fuck, and the poor sonovabitch never thought that he may need to have the forethought to always be armed. 
 True fear is being unarmed while someone with more common sense shows up with more weapons and wants to rape/rob/ whatever you and the cops are no where to be found. No matter how much we try to take the power of violence out of every day life, you only get one life, one working body and when shit gets to the nitty gritty its rule of the jungle man, no two ways about it.

"Okay, so this happened last year but as I've only recently joined Reddit I'd thought I'd post this. 
 My name is Brad and at the time my two best friends were a boy called M, and a girl N, and we'd been inseparable for years. We'd always joked about having the threesome but at this point I was a virgin. 
 One night we're at N's local pub, and we get absolutely wasted and decide that the night is young and we should go for a walk down the canal near the pub. The area is secluded so we sit down to star-gaze and eventually we start three-way kissing (not an uncommon drunk activity for us at the time). 
 This turned a little heavier and before you know it we're both simultaneously knuckle deep in N and well on the way to the joke becoming a reality. Eventually, amongst the moans, N gasps ""I want both of you to fuck me"" - a sentence that two 20 year old best friends rarely ignore for long. 
 Knowing I was a virgin M tells me to go for it, so after attending to N for a little longer I drop my pants, and with all enthusiasm, proceed to lose my virginity to one of my best friends, as she is sucking on my other best friend's dick. Not a bad way to lose it you may think. 
 The threesome is going brilliantly, me and M do the cliché eiffel tower and high-five over her back because you have to right? after we high five, M's eye flicker down towards my junk, his face drains of colour and he quickly mutters ""shit man there's fuck load of blood!"" 
 I pull out to find my rapidly softening dick POURING with blood. I'd somehow managed to split my foreskin right down the middle. We then rush me to hospital, by which point I was feeling faint from lack of blood (and alcohol) and spent the night in a minor surgery ward with the specialist warning I would probably have to go for an emergency circumcision. 
 In the end there was no harm done and I was let home at 5pm the next day with a bandage round my fella and a wounded ego. Before I left I got talking to the guy in the bed next to me who turned out to be a cancer patient, after explaining my story he winced and said ""fuck man! and I though I had it bad"" - made me smile i must say. 
 I see the funny side of it personally, and think it's a great story about losing my virginity. Even better I now have a weird battle scar on my cock when it's hard and I think it looks quite dashing haha.",2355,"Lost v-plates with two best friends > ripped foreskin in half and spent night in hospital > Survived with battle scars!

"I was 17 and going through a rough time. I had just started taking benzos (ativan in this case), and anti-depressants. I was working at Subway: 
 I'm having a particularly rough night and I'm about 5mgs of Ativan deep. Some guy comes in with his mother. The guy was probably in his mid-early twenties and was a gangster/wannabe/freshguy/whatever. 
 I'm normally a pretty stern person and this tends to rub people the wrong way. So this guy and me are kind of subversively going at it while I was making his sandwich... a lot of tension. Basically, we're both being rude fucks. 
 Anyway, I ring them up and he goes to eat. After a few seconds, he comes back to the register and very impolitely says, ""do I get any napkins."" 
 And I, very impolitely retort, ""fuck you."" 
 It turns into a shit-talking storm and his mom gets involved; they tell me I'm rude and that he's going to beat me up, etc. 
 I'm behind the counter and his mom is trying to usher him out. This is where I went from wrong to stupidly wrong - I start following him to the door. For whatever reason, I wanted a fight. It's sucks, but it happened. I'm not an aggressive person, for the record. You put anyone on that amount of medication and they're going to act out-of-character. 
 Eventually, he charges after me. Knowing I had no choice I this point, I throw the first, and only punch I ended up throwing, square in his mouth. I was not prepared for his assault, re: medication. He was larger than me, and I was out of my mind, so to speak. With that being said, I quickly ducked my head and grabbed on to him for dear life. 
 All in all, I took a couple shots to the back of my head, and I had a few bruises on my back, but you wouldn't have been able to tell I had been in a fight. (Oh yeah, my co-worker decided it'd be best to watch for a while before stepping in.) 
 After we're pulled apart, he threatens to come back ""loaded"" and with friends. Fuck it. I didn't care. He leaves, and I go about my business. 
 15 minutes later we get a call... he threatens me again. Now I get a bit worried. We call the owner, and he comes down. I am so out of it at this point I really don't know what's going on, and my perspective now is, ""wow, you're a fucking idiot, me."" Then, it was a bit different. 
 He gets down there, we tell him the story, he looks at the cameras...

"Like the title says, I have had ex girlfriends enraged and infuriated because I have ""talked about their shit"" to people. 
 For them, they get so irate because I tell people about their insecurities and our relationship when I am sad, confused, lost touch with reality and need someone to talk to. These are the people who's advice matter to me, when I can't figure things out on my own. 
 I've been in abusive relationships (like my recent ex) and I thought she left the house, but she came back in and heard me telling my mom how upset I was that her insecurities about me watching rated R movies enraged her. Before that phonecall to my mom, my ex named called, belittled me, called me a lying piece of shit that will never have a decent future, and ran out the door. 
 I am the type of person that cannot internalize things. I have to get things out. I'm an alcoholic on house arrest that is only allowed to go to work, AA, and outpatient therapy, so maybe I am just accustomed to talking about pretty much everything without any problems. Hell, I have no problem admitting here on Reddit that I have a shit load of psychological issues, most recently understanding how codependent I am to the point that I did absolutely everything my ex insecure girlfriend wanted me to do. I was literally doing anything and everything she said to make her happy. 
 Anyway, do you do this? Did your significant others do this or hate this too? I'm not ""telling her shit"" because that shit is part of my own life and what I have to go through. I guess I understand they are not comfortable with others knowing that she slept with a blanky from when she was a kid, but I have no issue saying anything about my own crazy shit. 
 She won't ever come back to my house because now my mom knows the issue with her and movies. So am I an asshole? She literally was leaving me there, dumping me pretty much, and I needed to feel consoled because my mother I know is someone who would never judge me. 
 What's your take on this? Maybe I am selfish for talking about her behind her back? But to say it's only her shit I feel is just untrue. If it involves me and my life, why am I not allowed to seek advice from loved ones? 
 If she knew I was posting on here talking about her or asking strangers about our relationship, I would most likely be given ""revenge"" for hurting her to this level.",2371,ex GF went nuts when she found out I talk about her and us to people. why? why even have friends if you cannot talk to them about your relationship?,148,0.7592836022377014,0.0262363702058792,0.0100584058091044,0.0001778041187208,0.715623676776886,0.0026134504005312,0.0016728114569559,0.0002031616022577,0.155074194073677,0.0011344505473971,0.0043842513114213,0.0002092971699312,"""I have had ex girlfriends enraged and infuriated because I have ""talked about their shit"" to people.

"So, I caught my girlfriend fucking the guy who beat the shit out of her.  Backstory - Her and I dated a year ago for six months.  We had a very bad breakup.  She dated this guy right after and about a month ago he beat the shit out of her (broke her eye socket, nose, etc.) and left her for dead.  She calls me up, apologizes for everything bad she did and said to me, and wanted to get back together.  Me, being an idiot, agreed to get back with her.  We had a great time - no problems or fights. 
 I spend the night at her place (nothing happened, just cuddled) and she told me in the morning she wanted to go over to her ex-boyfriends.  She came up with some bullshit of why she needed to so I dropped her off there.  I told her she needed to keep in constant contact with me and if I didn't hear from her for an hour, I would come over to check on stuff.  She even came up with a code phase to let me know if things were bad. 
 We chat on Facebook for awhile, then I suddenly stop hearing from her.  I asked if she was OK and 20 minutes late she tells me that she is 'charging her phone' and cooking dinner.  Two hours roll around and I still do not hear anything from her (after asking her to call me several times)  I ended up driving over there after texting her 'if I don't hear from you in 10 minutes, I'm coming over there and calling the cops'. 
 I get there and check out the place (he lives in a basement apartment) and you can see right in.  I check the place out (the front door was locked) and didn't see anyone or hear anything.  I look again and see my girlfriends pants on the couch.  Still hear nothing.  10 minutes later, I see both of them, walking out of his bedroom (the light was off the entire time I was there) and see them casually walk over to the couch and he sits down and she lays across the couch.  I knock on the window as loud as I can and he lets me in.  I storm past him looking for my girlfriend and she pretends she's been in the shower the entire time.  I yell 'It's fucking over' and storm out. 
 She claimes nothing happened, it was all innocent, I'm overreacting, etc.  That I'm stalking her.  I feel I was in the right to check things out, and I believe I reacted very well to the situation.

"I was living in a downtown studio for about a year at this time. I was headed back up my elevator after I had went into work and got sent home basically right away since my job rescheduled. (Contractor) As the elevator doors are closing I see this good looking asian girl walking towards me so I hold the doors open. She gets on and right away starts commenting on how she likes my sweater and starts asking if I smoke trees. I told her yes, and she told me that she just moved into the building and would be over to my place with a blunt in about fifteen minutes. Turns out she moved into the suite right next to mine. Score. So fifteen minutes pass and there's a knock at the door. It's her. She comes inside and we start playing some video games (her idea, score.) and smoking her blunt. We got into conversation about what we do, and she tells me she is a stripper at a place about a block from the building. She also told me that she had done some adult films. ""Whoa."" After she left I spent a good two hours scouring the internet looking for her scenes. Once I found them, I was just like damn.. they were like hardcore with choking and rough sex. She would come over at least twice a week for about a month, always seeming a little flirty but not over the top. She informed me early that she had a boyfriend who was a boxer so I was a little hesitant to try and make a move. 
 One day I passed her in the hallway and she told me that her boyfriend dumped her and she was moving to Vegas. She said she'd be over later that night to hang out though. Day passes and night falls, I get a phone call from her. She tells me to come over. I of course say yes. I walk into her suite and she is fully naked. She pulls me over to her couch and unbuttons my pants. All I'm thinking is holy shit.. I've seen you get fucked on video and now you're about to fuck me. This is a total fantasy, I have already fapped to your videos. She starts going down on me real rough like, deep throat and like gagging herself. It was fucking great. After that she just kinda pushed me against the couch and started riding me. We fucked for a while that night. Porn actress, riding my dick. It was a good night. She was gone about two days later.

"isn't it crazy how when you think you're really fucked in terms of being searched,  that you get incredibly lucky? 1st time - got woken up at 7am to pigs serving a warrant on my old roommate one year in college, they barely let us put on pants ... so only after i put them on and they start frisking us (and  this  time, the case had absolutely nothing to do with me, I just happened to be the roommate) .... so it's only then do I realize that I had a ""Pokeball"" roll from the night before (big a couple years ago in SoCal) stashed in the coin pocket of the jeans I had just thrown on ... so I had to try to not visibly freak out while the cop searched all my pockets; SOMEHOW he missed it, my guess is that it was all the way in the corner and near the  seam ... good thing it was small enough too.. 
 another (and the most recent) time was getting searched at a routine checkpoint going into Isla Vista, my old college town in SB ... a ton of cops lined up along the road, so turning around would have been suspicious; so anyway since the car reeked of the dank that we had smoked a couple times along the way, the cops gave me and my buddy an infraction after finding his pipe and weed, which was only a $100 fine and wouldn't even show up as a misdemeanor ... lol and this was on 4/20, of all days ...

"I just wanted to share my big dick success story with you guys because we get so many posts about BD problems and the good stuff needs to be mentioned as well! 
 I've been together with my girlfriend for a several months now and we finally had sex for the first time. We would have done it much sooner but it took her a while to get an appointment at the gynecologist's to get the BC pill. Anyway, you guys had me all scared and troubled because of all those stories of a big dick not fitting in, causing severe paint etc. and I was super cautious when I first put it in after having eaten her out for a while. 
 I was a tad nervous and it took me a bit longer to get fully erect, but when it was and I had a condom on (we want to use two contraceptives for now, just to be sure) it went in like a charme. I took my time and put it in reaaal slow, and to my surprise it went in all the way without causing her any pain. Out with it and back in all the way again, she smiles. I went slow for a minute until she said I should go faster - hell yeah! So I fucked her silly, balls deep and as fast as I wanted. I lasted only two or three minutes, but after 5 minutes I was ready again and was able to keep going for another 20. 
 Turns out she loves the feeling of it inside her, and I can go as fast or slow as I want, it feels amazing for her. When I asked her which positions she preferred she told me I should suit myself, as long as it's deep inside she was happy. Also, I haven't hit her cervix yet and I can put all eight inches in without a problem. 
 Another thing she told me is that she prefers the climaxes she gets from sex to the ones she gets from being eaten out, and she is often wet enough from the start so foreplay isn't even imperative. I can go down on her if I like but spontaneous sex without much preperations is also an option. We had sex five times in three days now and she doesn't seem to get sore. 
 On top of that, our libidos match. Seems like we're very much sexually compatible. Fuck yeah!! 
 However, one thing that might have made this much smoother and easier is the fact that I fingerbanged her a lot before we actually had sex (as I said we had to wait a while because of the pill). First one, then two, then three fingers. Four on a good day. So I suppose she was well stretched by the time we actually had sex. Se didn't come from my fingerbanging though, it wasn't deep enough.",2414,"Lost my virinity together with a girl who is very much sexually compatible with me.

We get along well and our mutual love for food means that we won't touch each others ingredients without permission. Some time through out this all, we get into a routine where I buy bin bags and/or kitchen towel and you buy liquid wash for the dishes and sponges. It was fun! 
 It's fucking amazing that you two met someone in the halls that you can get along with. Even more amazing that you are getting so close that they come visit our flat more often. It's great news that you two are going to live with the guys you deemed best friends, but seriously you two and your mates are assholes. 
 It's past midnight and you lot are causing a fucking racket in the flat. I can't sleep with all the noise and my sleeping pattern is fucked up already. I thought that it wasn't a big deal at the start. I mean after new years you guys were noisy sometimes, but it got quiet cause you would go out to clubs. But then you decided to stay inside after a few weeks and the noise doesn't stop until after. 
 It's great that you tell me that you are being noisy. Great that you admitted it. Nice of you to tell me that if there's an exam or an assignment due in to tell you and keep the noise level down. Here's the surprise though, I don't have to tell you that I have an exam the night before or an assignment due the night before because you lot should be considerate enough to keep the fucking noise down. 
 Seriously people are trying to sleep and you think it's a good idea screaming and shouting and putting on music so loud my whole room vibrates? I probably wouldn't complain so much if my room isn't across the lounge where you all decide to be a riot. I probably would let this night go like any other because I realise I only have two months left of having to deal with your shit before I get to never hopefully see you again. 
 However, for the love of God, don't smoke in the fucking lounge. I can feel the damned draft from when you open the huge windows in the lounge. What makes you think the smell of weed won't drift into my room? My door is right across the lounge's for fuck's sake! Thank you for making my room smell like a fucking stoner's den.

"First of all,if you dont want to hear a cringy story about an insecure 17 years old boy,i'd advice you to leave the thread right now. 
 So i am your normal kid from high school:awkward,decent social life,large group of friends.
Life is pretty good i guess,except for the fact that i am extremely insecure about the way i look and this affected me to try to hit on girls. 
 But with New years around the corner i convinced myself to try giving my first kiss,and this huge party i was invited to looked like the perfect occasion to do so. 
 So fast forward a few days,me and my friends(10 guys and 8 girls) arrive at the party and it was AWESOME.
Tons of cute girls,a kick-ass Dj set,a free-bar etc..
We had dinner and after the music started playing, i had a few beers in the desperate attempt of boosting my confidence. 
 Being my first time drinking i didnt know how much it effects your fears(in my case,being rejected) and after 20 minutes me and another friend with the same new years resolution, hit the dancefloor looking for girls to approach.
After 1 hour or so,we found a group of girls and started dancing with them. 
 And this is where my first fuck up happens:I was dancing behind a very cute girl when she looked behind her shoulders and started backing up,bumping against my crotch.
Being the awkward fucker i am,i thought she did it by accident,so i moved a few inches away.
Now im not the best in picking up signals but after this kept on happening i grabbed her by her hips and pulled her against me.
She looked at me,smiled and started grinding her ass on my dick.
I couldnt fucking believe it! Meanwhile i was thinking to myself that this was actually happening to me and how heavenly it felt,10 minutes passed and i remembered about my resolution. 
 As i went in for the kiss,some fucking retard jumped on the dj stage with a motherfucking fire extinguisher and not thinking straight,started spraying directly in OUR direction!
Note: if you had a fire-extinguisher sprayed at your face,you may know that breathing it makes your lings burn like hell and choking back for air.
And so i did. I elbow-ed my way through the nearest emergency exit and finally breathed fresh air. 
 But,as i stated before,this party was HUGE and even after spending all the night looking for her,i had no success.
So here i am,still kiss-less,still without confidence but know i have an irrational hate for extinguishers.",2418,"Tried to get my first kiss,had stuff sprayed at my face,did not make it by seconds.",83,0.8733076453208923,0.008275045081973,0.0393076874315738,0.0001330608210992,0.8374342322349548,0.0010099899955093,0.0133575294166803,0.0001401644694851,0.5160638689994812,0.0003629436541814,0.0274825673550367,0.0001717501145321,A 17-year-old boy tries to kiss a girl for the first time at a huge party.

He records everything he observes, publishing it to his shitty blog (because we all know Makoto is an annoying shitposter). His detective friend, that's a guy, finds out he's in love with this chick that's the full package. His friend, being a total bro, decides to set them up so he can be the best wingman ever. Makoto later discovers he's been entered into a contest to become a god of all time and space. He must kill to survive, and he's been given the ability to see the future on his phone. He later discovers that this hot girl like him back, after breaking some guys phone (but not after fucking him first). He later realizes he's in love with his bro, after the bro confesses to him and then they fuck. He then ditches them to fuck the other contestants, because Makoto is alpha. Makoto is later kidnapped by his ex/ back together first girl, and found by his friends only to fuck them as a thank you. After a few more arcs and casual meet ups with his ex lovers, his bro admits he's pregnant with Makoto's child. Makoto, in an attempt to make everything right for his new child, decides to win the contest so he can go back in time and make it so he wasn't such a cunt that could've gotten unlimited sex if he wasn't a bitch and left the first girl. In the final arc Makoto is told by his now 8 month pregnant bro that he can't unfuck the people he fucked, the original girl proceeds to murder his bro to prove he was lying about being pregnant, which he was (I think, I rage quit at some point and started again a few hours after). Who would've guessed he wasn't pregnant? After a few days, because Makoto is a cunt, Makoto FINALLY sees that girl #1 may be batshit crazy. They later go to her AMAZING boat, and go on a wonderful cruise. Oh yeah, she killed him, and she won the contest. She then becomes god and goes back in time, instead of deciding to just change the outcome of the past, FUCK LOGICAL SHIT! She then has to relive this world except now there is this crazy hot/ cool, 10/10, terrorist girl with even better god powers than her midget. During this time, Makoto is being a cunt and fucking everyone from the past because he can't be commuted any longer than he lasts in bed.

"Hello.  I am a girl, 19 years old, want to have anal with my bf of 4 months.  His cock is perfect for me, I really like the feeling of it inside of me and the way he uses it, he is very in tune with my pleasure and massages his hard cock against all the exact right spots - I love having sex with him!  Anyway, we are both rather tall and athletic people, I am 5'11 and he is 6'2, we are both inexperienced and curious about having sex that is more challenging. He is making me excited about pushing my boundaries in ways I never would have thought I could!  So, yes, you get it, I'm excited.  Anyway, for the first time the other day, he started playing with my ass.  I was lying in bed, waking up slowly, and he was massaging my ass and kissing my face, and he started working his fingers in between my cheeks... I was kind of half asleep, I normally wouldn't do this, but I kept angling my asshole toward him without thinking about it, and his fingers eventually made their way to my asshole.  He started circling it with his fingers, and god, it was the most amazing thing ever.  I started panting and clinging to him, and he touched my pussy - I was soaked.  I begged him to put a finger inside of me, he did, and after only a minute of him petting my clit and feeling his hard cock against my leg I was cumming against him.  He got really excited, pushed his finger further into my asshole, and fucked me like that.  The sex was amazing, feeling him sliding his finger in and out of my asshole made me cum three times within half an hour which is unusual for me. 
 So, warning, here is the less sexy part...he pulled his finger out of me, and it was not completely nasty but it was kind of dirty because, it'm my poop hole, and I didn't expect anyone to stick their fingers inside of it.  Not a big deal, he loves me and he can wash his finger off.  But of course I can't help feeling a little self-conscious after that.  After all girls don't poop, right?  No, butt seriously, I am really, really eager and curious to explore playing with my ass and feeling his amazing cock inside of my ass!  Lord, I love the idea.  But I really want to be clean.  I'm wondering if you have any advice for general regular butt cleanliness/maintenance?  Do I really have to use an anal douche every single day?

"Why does the rest of the world get their little pussies all festered and swollen simply by Americans loving our country? Do you know WHY we know we are the best? Because you guys HATE us for loving our country. OBVIOUSLY when we have never visited your country or give a single hot fuck about its existence it hurts your feelings. I would say most of the world has a little insecurity when it comes to the US. When I lived in Europe I got pretty fucking good at blending in while in public. Having to hide the fact Im about twice as muscular as most euro males and much shorter made it hard but none the less I was able to ingratiate myself to the local flair well enough to not get picked out of a crowd as an American. But when the locals would find out I was american or hear me speak they automatically had some fucking shit to say about America. Ignorant Americans this, fat Americans that. It was a great experience being hated on just because I was born in the US. But I got to thinking obviously about where I come from and my culture (see thats what traveling and being cultured does, it allows you to view your culture from the outside - its a good deal) and where I come from (thats Texas BTW) if Im hanging out at a bar having a brew and I overheard some dude say oh Im from Holland, or Im Danish or Im french or whatever, I don't automatically see people make an overt attempt to let that person know what a bunch of buttfucking quitters the french are for letting Germany just walk into france, TWICE. I don't hear them say some shit about Dutch people are fucking tools or are just plain fucking weird, or that Danish people all make danish cookies. I don't see people doing that where Im from. Anyone who is reading this who has even been to my part of the US knows that in general we are a very warm welcoming friendly people, must like Aussies (I think Aussies and Texans are brothers by providence). Go to any major US city as a French person..go to NYC, to LA, to Chicago or Dallas..go to a bar...meet people..tell them you're french. You'll probably get some decently curious and impressed people, maybe one or two chide remarks about French not liking Americans etc. But go to a bar in Paris and tell them you're from Dallas Texas...HOLY FUCKIN SHIT COWBOY you will get HATED on.

"Basically, you're full of shit on virtually every point. 
 What does OVERvaccination have to do with indoor/outdoor?  Because it is primarily the ""save the kitty by locking it up INDOORS"" kind of idiot owners who take their ""kitty"" to the (equally ignorant) vet twice a year for (entirely unnecessary, but profitable) vaccinations. 
 FACT: Cats in the US have had a FIVE-FOLD increase in diabetes in the past 30 years (that's a larger increase than within the human population) -- and yeah it DOES have to do with too much dry-cat kibble, but it also has to do with a BORING, SEDENTARY life ""in a cage"" -- so the cats eat and sleep and... well that's about all they are allowed to do. 
 More poisons outside than inside?  You have GOT to be frigging kidding me!  The ""outside"" poisons you seem cite (Lillies? GMAFB!) are ridiculous -- cat's won't bother with that -- what is dangerous to cats is the array of chemicals in your house (everything from formaldehyde in the carpets and fabrics and your ""kitty"" and you so childishly insist on referring to it, lives it's life a LOT closer to that than you do -- to all the crap you spray everywhere, and your cat is a lot smaller being, one that doesn't wear shoes and must ""lick"" its feet and fur and so the toxins build up much faster than they do in your fatuous arse). Ever hear of feline renal failure?

"Hi everyone. 
So today was a really weird day. I had 6 classes, nothing unusual. First pair of classes went completely normal. 
Then we had the school librarian, a very annoying lady, come in and sub for our French classes. So first class passes, we do nothing of real matter, then 2nd class she decides to give us a test, in which this certain guy in my class doesn't take it easy (he has a mental illness of some sort), he doesn't do his test, he just mocks the librarian the whole time. 
At one point she snaps and writes him a detention slip, in which his reply is ""This has gone on for too long!"", stands up, grabs the note from her hands, slaps her and kicks her in the stomach! Me and my friends (6 guys in total) take a second to realize what the fuck is happening, we jump up and try splitting him from her (at that point he's pulling her hair and yelling at her), it took us 30 seconds full of threats and he finally stopped, he straight up pulled a lock of her hair and held it in his hand like a fucking trophy. The lady ran the fuck out of the classroom and this fucking retard (pardon my language) sat down as if nothing happened. 
So there we were, about of us making a circle around him, all 15 girls in shock and the other 5 guys are laughing their asses off. 
In the break between the 4th and the 5th class the other guys and I hang in front of the teachers' lounge, discussing what the fuck happened. Then we see the headteacher coming along the stairs, still with her bags and jacket, all the other teachers crowded her and told her what happened, she asked us if it's true, in which we replied positively. The headteacher looked at him (he was on the other side of the long hallway), called him and took him to her office. 
We had our 5th class discussing the incident with the teacher (it was a really appropriate class, too - psychology). Then our hero knocks on the door, peeks in and says (word by word) ""Hi everyone, the headteacher said I should go home, see you tomorrow!"". This is where I got angry, why the fuck would he not be expelled instantly? He assaulted a teacher, he fully understood what he was doing, he was being immature and it resulted in punishment, and punishments shouldn't be taken like a fucking 3rd grader. ""Go home""? Get there and get home schooled, attack your mother and father, I don't want you and your retarded (pardon me again) mind near me again. 
Sorry, I had to put my rant on somewhere.",2446,"Special needs kid in my class gets angry over test, doesn't do it, rather insults substitute all class long, she writes him a detention slip, he goes bonkers and attacks her, headteacher leaves him off with a warning and asks him to go home",240,0.7887359857559204,0.1204721927642822,0.0330594442784786,0.0002172863314626,0.7657570242881775,0.0019147743005305,0.0147858513519167,0.0005041646072641,0.4045844078063965,0.006653023418039,0.0442390143871307,0.0012463566381484,A French teacher subbed in on one of her classes.

"Not sure if this counts, and it will probably get buried anyway, but it was definitely creepy. 
I dressed up as Han Solo for a Star Wars convention, and I was insanely proud of the work I put into it. I had every part of the costume down to a T, complete with blaster and a 3ft tall chewbacca backpack designed to make it look like he's hanging on your shoulders. I even won a costume contest, which was awesome (or surprising would be more appropriate) because I'm a girl, and I was up against some other ladies who were definitely much more attractive and much less conservatively dressed.
The creepy part came in after I won the contest and, apparently REALLY pissed off one of the spectators in doing so. She wasn't dressed up at all, but I think her daughter was..? (this lady had to have been at least in her late 40's) So basically, I was experiencing a pretty awesome natural high of having just won a contest. I'm feeling great, life is good....and out of nowhere, this insane woman just starts shouting, ""I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS YOU FUCKING EWOK BITCH!! YOU CAN FIND ME IN THE PARKING LOT. YOU STUPID EWOK WHORE!!"" 
She's screaming at me from clear across the room, and the fact that she kept referring to me as an ""ewok bitch"" was definitely throwing me off because I wasn't  quite  sure I was the one she was so angry with. After all, I'm incredibly non-confrontational and I definitely hadn't approached her at any point. Finally, after having several strangers warn me that she was getting ready to ""jump my white Star Wars ass,"" I decided to book it out of there and not cause any drama.
BITCH FOLLOWS ME INTO THE PARKING LOT. I kept my cool, and allowed her to continue to scream ""ewok bitch"" at me until I had finally had enough. I was so god damned incredibly annoyed. And not at her attitude, or persistent aggression. No, what finally brought me to my breaking point was when I finally stopped, turned around, and yelled in her face, ""it's a WOOKIE, YOU STUPID FUCKING CUNT. NOT AN EWOK!! Get the fuck out of here with your ignorant ass!"" Luckily there were people there to separate us, so we didn't get into a physical altercation, even though it definitely was going down at that point. 
I guess the only thing that made it creepy was that I've never had anyone so openly and aggressively attack me like that when it was completely unprovoked. I still, to this day, have no idea what I did to this woman that made her SO incredibly angry with me.

"DON'T GET FUCKING MARRIED. If you do find a chick, do NOT marry her under any circumstances within a year (or 2-3) of actually meeting her. 
 Finance wise: Pay yourself first. Put at least $100-200 a month into savings and don't touch it. That's your emergency fund for car wrecks, gov't shutdowns, etc. 
 Next, invest in a TSP/Roth IRA for your retirement. You can get one either through your bank (Definitely join USAA, great bank) or through the military. 
 Next, learn how to budget your money. Be conscious about your money. You'll actually have money for the first time, meaning you'll be able to buy things you never could before (usually). There is no issue with buying things that you enjoy HOWEVER if you do buy things to support your hobby, pay with cash/debit. 
 Avoid credit cards and loans like the plague. 
 If you're going to purchase a vehicle, go at least 10 minutes away from base and bring someone whoi knows what they're doing. Don't bring the shit-bag NCO, find the one that cares. Don't accept any sort of interest rate on a car over 5-10% if you have no credit. 
 I think that covers most of the financial bit. Now for the actual service. 
 Always maintain the attitude that today could be the last day in the Army for you. With budget cuts and force reductions happening every time the wind changes, you have to realize that you could be out tomorrow. 
 How do you prevent that? By being fucking stellar. 
 There's plenty of ""shitty"" things in the military. Shitty assignments, jobs, duties, NCOs, etc. 
 Don't let the shittiness of someone else affect how you do your job. 
 Don't risk your career for someone elses. While you're in, take pride in everything you do. Where I'm at right now is perhaps the stupidest fucking thing in the world, but I put in good work. 
 Get outside! The military loves free PR and volunteering is no exception. 
 The ""ideal"" military service member is one who does their job well, listens and follows orders, adds to the mission, gets out into the community and serves the community, and is generally a decent well rounded person. 
 You may have a shitty NCO. They may not tell you any of this. They may not even care, spare the ""don't get caught doing something stupid."" 
 You should care. 
 You're not only serving the military, but what you do is how you serve yourself and your future. 
 Also, they may tell you to go to school and get college stuff. You get $4500 a year in Tuition assistance. Use it if you want, or don't.",2486,"Go fucking read what I wrote.

"Part of this is definitely NSFW. 
 When I was fifteen I e-dated, because I was too socially awkward to actually ask a girl out.  One of the girls I dated was a stereotype for the 'good church girl gone nympho behind the bedroom doors.'  We dated for a few months, broke up on good terms, kept in loose contact over the years. 
 Fast forward to three years ago (I'm 24 now), and we start talking regularly again.  I find out she still has feelings for me, and still being too awkward to have a real girlfriend at the time, we ended up agreeing to e-date again.  This time, though, she has a job and is more than willing to make the six hour drive from my house to hers to see me face to face. 
 First time goes great, lots of sex, lots of talking, great time.  This continues for a few months, I drop lots of $$ on her because I feel like we're really hitting it off.  I should mention now that she wont give blowjobs, absolutely refused to do anal, likes drinking.  A lot.   A lot.   She was a 5'1, 110lb blonde with the alcohol tolerance of an infant, but she wanted every drink stronger than the last.  Several times I'd had to take care of her during after having too much to drink, but she had a convincing way of using her body to make me not mind her being drunk up until that point. 
 Then, one night, the crazy came out.  We were doing our thing, like normal, messing around before we were about to have sex.  She had a little more to drink than normal.  Suddenly, she starts clambering all over me, ripping my clothes off, and proceeds to ride me like its her job while screaming things like ""Fuck me in the ass,"" ""Cum all over me,"" ""Make me your bitch,"" ""I'll have your babies,"" all in an incredibly slurred voice while half crying.  And then she passed out.  Passed. The. Fuck. Out.  On top of me.  Mid-sex.  So far, all of our encounters had been pretty vanilla.  Enjoyable, but nothing extraordinary or kinky. 
 The entire rest of night is spent with me holding her hair and putting her head in the trash can every time she puked while barely conscious.  At one point I thought she might actually have alcohol poisoning, but she was aware enough to slur out that it would ruin her life if I took her to the ER.  Against my better judgement I didn't.  The next day she got up, acted like nothing happened, left, and I never heard from her again.  I tried a few times to contact her to make sure she was OK, but voicemail every time.

"There's this one guy. I'll not go into specifics. 
 Let's just say he's this pretty good looking guy, so a lot of girls like him, but I've always hated him. He's a dick-riding mother fucker. That's like the only way to describe him. 
 Anyway, I might be wrong, and you could call me 'jealous' or whatever but if I am reincarnated into him or something I'd probably kill myself to save people like myself from this misery. So, basically, he's just like this really ginormous phoney fucker who talked to me one day out of the blue, and he was really 'friendly' and all, so though I never liked him very much (from the way he acts and just his general demeanour, never gave off a good vibe to me) I entertained him, and after some small talk he asks me for my number and I give it to him. So we text occasionally to see whether either of us are going to be at the same place at the same time, blah blah. 
 Then suddenly, he just stops talking to me and unfollows me on all the social media accounts he followed me on (petty, I know, but still...) and whenever I see him he just acts like a complete cunt squirrel, like he'd openly talk shit about other people in front of me, and he'd say something behind my back which my friend, who would overhear, tells me about. I've also seen him with another friend of mine and they seemed to be having a good time, and the next time I see him he was talking shit about how annoying and stupid our mutual friend was. 
 So one day, my friends and I were on the topic of people being dicks, and my friends ask me 'who don't you like? you seem to be alright with everybody,' and 'you're so neutral, is there somebody you don't like?' which kind of implies that I don't really show blatantly who I don't like, because I don't like  a lot  of people, trust me. Anyway, I asked them whether they really wanted to know, because he was really popular and well liked and shit so they'd probably be in disbelief, and then they said yes, so I said his name. 
 And they suddenly told me they hated him as well, and there's just stories being exchanged of him being a dick to everybody and shit, and so I discovered our mutual dislike for this asshole. It was kind of nice that my hatred for him was not unfounded. Every time I see him I swear my mood drops, but right now I'm just not giving a fuck whenever I see him and I'm determined not to let this guy ruin a good day.

"This comment is getting lost somewhere as soon as I post it but here goes anyway: 
 I'm not donating for a very specific reason. I would LOVE to have signed papers and a signed copy of your photobook and a Team Snoop shirt, and I have the money to donate so I could very easily spend 500 right now and have my own personalized thank you message from Snoop. I can do it. I'm not going to because of what the money is going to. I'm all for supporting kids in inner cities but for football? Are you kidding me? What you're doing is using your fame and the desirability of your persona to get money out of people so that you can turn kids away from the pursuit of higher education and giving them the impression that things are being handed to them. 
 If your campaign was to set up after-school science programs or libraries or art classes I would totally be with you. I would feel like I'm helping create a new generation of Newtons and Einsteins and Plancks from impoverished neighborhoods. That resonates with what I believe in. But the thought of being even partially responsible for a young child's decision to put sports in front of scholastic integrity makes me sick. 
 I can make a deal with you, though. If you're even reading this it's a Christmas miracle, but here it is: I will donate $400 to a charity that supports literary and scientific education in impoverished inner city areas, and you just sit down and relax, buddy, because I don't even want a ""Snoop Dogg E-Card."" 
 I want to go to sleep tonight knowing that the difference I made to the world is one that will improve it, not one that will double a kid's curling strength and cut their vocabulary in half as a result. 
 ""are you suggesting Snoop is trying to lead kids astray?"" 
 NOT AT ALL.  I think that His actions are noble, good-hearted, and have great intentions... but take a look at history and you'll see that programs like this don't create poets or visionaries, but assholes. Assholes who never leave the ghetto and have no actual skills to get them out of the ghetto (except maybe running... but that'll last until they get hungry). 
 ""haha, you're probably a fat embittered fuck who can't play football because your tits are in the way of your knees!"" 
 At least I got out of the fucking ghetto.  You heard me. I watched the football-hopeful kids maintain their second-grade education all the way through high-school and then watched them flunk out of college never paying a cent thanks to FAFSA and TAP. 
 FOOTBALL HATER!!!

"I've had sex with my friend's mom. 
 She hasn't found out. 
 Backstory: I would hang out with this girl a lot, she was new in town, didn't have too many friends. We'd go bowling a lot, movies, whatever. She wasn't really allowed to go out too often, and only with a select number of people. Her mom loved me to death. Fast forward to a year or so later.. 
 Her daughter had a thing for me.. We messed around. I got oral, never sex though. I knew she was a freak, but never actually had sex with her because I knew she got around before she moved to where we lived. 
 The girl finally found a boyfriend. The guy was a total piece of shit. Didn't know how to treat a girl. Anyway, one day she asks if I wanna see pictures of her, I'm like yeah sure why not. Well she sends me a link (now taken down, of course right?) of her and her bf on one of those amateur couples websites. Graphic photos: cum shots, anal, you name it. Basically /r/gonewild (M)(F). 
 At that point, I did what any reasonable person would do. I shared the link.  (I promise you this is going somewhere). Shared the link, mutual friend tells the mom, it all comes back on me.. Daughter gets kicked out of the house. (Whoops my bad) 
 Fast forward past that.. 
 I had moved away, and her mom and I would keep in touch over MSN, and Skype. First it was messenger, then it was webcam. Anyway..with her daughter gone, I would flirt with her and it ended up later that I had her mom getting naked on Skype. It's crazy how much her and her daughter acted the same on Skype when it came to flashing and giggling etc. 
 We always talked about hooking up if I moved back. Well.. I ended up moving back. One night we're on webcam and she's getting topless and I'm like.. ""Uh why are we doing this on webcam? I'm 5 minutes away"". After some talking, she finally said ""come over."" 
 So I did. And I slammed her hard. Best. Fucking. Sex. Ever. One thing I've learned about ""MILFs"" is that... They've usually got their tubes tied.. And they are the best sex anyone can ever ask for. They know what they want, they're down for anything.. And it's amazing. 
 The daughter was forgiven and moved back in. 
 Most memorable time....
Once was on Christmas Eve. We were FaceTiming and the mom held me by her side as she went upstairs and said ""someone is going to bring me a Christmas present"" . I guess when the mom says she's going to have company over, the daughter stays upstairs. That was the biggest adrenaline rush.. Sneaking in the front door, knowing the daughter could come down at any moment. Then slamming the mom, and leaving.",2586,"Yes. I had sex with my friend's mom. It's somewhat like the pornos. It. Was.

"I feel like I'm about to vomit. Tonight I was at dinner with my grandpa and dad. After we were finished grandpa was showing me some photos he took recently of my brother. Then he asks me ""How do I get all these damned cat photos off my phone?"" 
 That's weird, I usually take a lot of shots for a photo. It seems really out of character for Grandpa to take more than one picture a month, let alone multiple shots. So I ask him ""Cat photos? How many do you take? I usually take a whole lot of cat photos that I never delete."" 
 He goes on ""Well some of them are really cute and I want to keep those but there's too damned many. I don't need all those cat photos"" 
 I tell him ""Maybe you're looking at your app that saves all the photos in the Google cloud and aren't actually on your phone. Let me see."" I had remembered that I tried deleting some photos that were on my cloud account but there was some sort of weird error, so I never really tried again. 
 He shows me one of the cat photos that he doesn't want. I immediately recognized it as an image I downloaded from /r/aww a long time ago. 
 HMM, THAT'S STRANGE. I DOWNLOADED THAT PICTURE OVER A YEAR AGO. 
 I also recognized a lot of unique photos that I downloaded onto my phone and  That's when I had the epiphany that he was logged into my Google account. I tried helping him out a long time ago with his Google play store. 
He has been logged into my account ever since. So that means... 
 Every photo that I took has been backed up instantly into my Google ""Photos"" account. 
 My entire history of photos. 
 Instantly. Every time. 
 All of my naked pics of my vagina, tits, asshole, and any dick pics from guys I dated, all the screen shots of conversations were uploaded... (edit: a lot of those dirty pictures were full body, with my face, and I had some close ups with dildos or my fingers in my vagina.) Those are all probably up there. He probably saw them all as they were uploaded. Fuck. Not to mention that I'm a perfectionist so I end up taking something like 15 to 20 pictures in slightly different angles before I find the right one. 
 There had to be WALLS of my vagina. 
 I didn't specifically see those while I was on his phone, but Google doesn't delete and grandpa doesn't know how to change any settings. I said ""Oh you're logged onto my account. I just sign out so you don't have to see all the cat pictures."" 
 Signed him out. Said I felt sick from eating too much, they wished me a good night and a safe trip since I'm leaving the country tomorrow. 
 I think I'll skip the return flight home and just stay out there.",2596,"I signed my grandpa into my Google account over a year ago, just now realized the horror of Google's instant auto backup for photo perfectionists.

"Fuck. 
 This is about how I fucked up my ankle, but also got really high and listened to music. Sheeeeeeeeeiitt, 'cuh. 
 So me and my man Jake haven't hung out in awhile, so he comes to stay the night, but we want to smoke a little, while dry, so we hit up our friend Marco, who has a good connection all the time, man. Dude named Jigsaw, I shit you not. 
 We were going for that hookup from another dude, Mikhail, who had recently just started selling, but we were used to cheap prices for some like low end mids, sorta like, crystally in some places, but it other not as much. The same to be said for light green places on the motherfucker. Well, we go to the hookup early with a ride from the unknowing mother, who also gave me 20 dollars. We come to find out that he really can't, so were stuck at some bullshit place for the next two hours. We get Rooster Booster to pass the time. 
 As a next and last resort, Jake and I are calling Marco for that dank. Says if we set up an appoitment, we can prolly get it. After awhile, we go home, and were there for an hour and a half maximum because soon after were walking down my bigass hill to meet up. 
 Now Marco is on crutches because he fucked up foot. 
 So we meet up with him at his back porch and he is blazed. 
 Jigsaw hasn't hit Marco back up, so we kinda chill for awhile when Marco says, ""Yo, let's go. One hit each."" 
 We walk to some god damn motherfuckin' bitch ass fuck face of a ditch, that just wants to fuck with me in particular. Motherfucker twisted my ankle, but I decide to be the bigger man and just walk it the fuck off to our destination. 
 Fucking bitch. 
 We end up at these steps, where we all 3 begin the toke session of shitty corners because of wind and inability to cover. 
 fuckwasifuckedup 
 I kinda had the Slender Man feel, like when he's apparently close how you lose hearing and sight goes static. I had that but sight was somewhat there. Not really was he there, but sorta. This happened right after I got into a bit of a tassle with that fuckin' bitch of a ditch. 
 So we walk about 60% there when we see a legit 5-o car roll slowly up the hill. 
 Okay. 
 So we duck behind the cars around us, and are just silent. 
 All good. We went back to Marco's crib for a while, while I think of calling my mom and telling her I snuck out to TP a house with some friends and that I fucked my ankle up . 
 I didn't, and soon after Jake and I are at my house. 
 I just drank an entire fuckin qaurt of strawb milk.

"My girlfriend does not take the pill but we've used condoms every single time we had sex. Yet she's got a late period and on top of that, she's having all these symptoms that indicates pregnacy. (slighty bigger boobs, chocolate cravings). 
 Last week, which was the week before she would get her period (and as far as I know the week a woman is fertile) we had sex and I did something stupid. On our second round when I was going to put the condom, I missed the correct side and then flipped it over and put it on. Which means I touched the outside of condom with my penis which was likely wet with semen. I don't think she came, but I remember her pussy being unusually warm (indicating she was ovulating) and even though she did not cum she got really wet, there was like this goo on my crotch which I assume is her lubrication. I read up it was also a sign of her ovulating. 
 Now i'm scared like a madman that she's pregnant. I'm writing this from work because I just cant put my mind on anything else. I'm too scared to ask her to do a pregnancy test. 
 I don't know what to do, abortion is illegal where I live so she would have to have the baby. That or find an illegal abortion clinic, but knowing her I don't think she would get over an abortion not to mention health risks. 
 Her parents will murder me, I don't know what to do. I'm desperate. My GF and I have this perfect relationship, everything is so great and I love her so damn much. It kills me to think our relationship could decay beucase of all this. I need help but there's literally no one I can talk to. 
 UPDATE 1: 
 We were talking tonight while having dinner and she said to me ""I havent had my period yet"", and then said started questioning me about the odds of her being pregnant. I had to keep it together saying how it would be impossible for her to be pregnant and how normal it is for women to get laid periods. By that moment she was shedding tears, and even though on the inside I was a hopeless 5 year old girl crying for help, I had to act out like it was nothing so she could confort herself. I'd like to thank all of your comments, because as you can see I'm going through this by myself completely, and it's really comforting to read you guys comments. But anyway, she decided to get a pregnancy test so tomorrow we will know for sure. Damn I lose my breath just to think of that test being positive, really wish I could just say I'm prepared to whatever comes, but the mere thought of having to deal with my girlfriend being pregnant makes me sick to my stomach. Anyway, thanks again for all your comments, they're being REALLY helpful. Will update tomorrow after the tests.",2664,i'm scared shitless my girlfriend is preganant.,47,0.7813005447387695,0.8963437676429749,0.0144574008882045,0.0107664773240685,0.7143922448158264,0.7404289245605469,0.0063294079154729,0.0012871638173237,0.0738458335399627,0.2189655303955078,0.0068379142321646,0.0042593046091496,"My girlfriend does not take the pill but we've used condoms every single time we had sex.

"Who the fuck would do that to the poor thing? 
 ppl need to see this to give thanks to people who are willing to take the time to save a life. 
 speaking of saving a life.... hear is one that happened on Saturday. I woke up like any other day. Around 11am i get a phone call from my friend. he is like ""Hey ThatEpicBaldGuy whats up? My client cancelled on me wanna come get some work done?? (he does tattoos out of his house) do you work today at all?"" 
 Well lucky for me i didn't so off to his place i went. now this is my first tattoo ever so i kinda have an idea so we start with the thought that its a Memorial for my father and i wanted it in honor of him and it HAD to be a sword and it had to look respectable so it took about 2 hours to get an idea and a super simple start on trace of a sword that my dad owned. O ya i forgot to mention that my father collected swords and daggers and knifes and some of them are sweet. 
 Anyways so it was just the outline of a sword on my arm done from ink-trace paper?? not sure what its called but basically its paper on both sides and you peal one side and put a pattern or designee on the ink and trace it then place the paper on skin and walla ink on arm. 
 So we need it to dry so smoke/drink brake (i don't smoke he dose) we go outside and his friend is over. (stumbled in drunk from a long walk like 50+k lol) As we are out he notices his blue pit bull is tossing something in the air and catching it so he goes and checks it out. He finds she caught a sparrow and was playing catch with it so he took it away. Now this thing looked haggard like it should be dead, missing almost all its feathers and stuff. On its wings you could see the feather bones but no stuff on it. Amazingly this thing is still alive se he puts it in a bud-wiser box and gives his dog SHIT. Also i should mention my friends friend wanted to kill it but my friend wouldn't let him saying ""A life is a life no matter how small"" and its funny coming from this guy if you knew him lol. 
 We all go inside and he brings the bird with him in the box and continue worken on my arm. About an hour after we come back inside i hear movement in the box this is good means hes getting stronger. about half hour after that we hear a some squeaks from him. Next thing ya know the bugger managed to get out of the box and now was wandering around the tattoo room haha good thing its not that big. so we finish my tattoo up for this sit in all the time this little sparrow is jumpen around trying to fly and chirp-en away but he cant fly cause his missing most of his feathers but he's gunna make sure the little guy gets better then send him on his way :P",2668,"Woke up got my first tattoo (in progress) halfway through the day finished with a fucked up sparrow singing for me

"FWIW, being a dude isn’t all its cracked up to be either.  External genitals means they swing around, get stuck to your leg, are vulnerable to impact, occasionally get erect and uncomfortable for no discernible reason.  Oh, and you can sit on them, which is about as fun as it sounds.  As for body hair, it’s like a full body fucking brillo pad that gets thicker with greater coverage as you age, but if you get rid of it all, you’re judged (“must be gay”).  You have to, in most circumstances, shave your face everyday, sometimes several times a day if it grows quickly. Or else you can have a beard (assuming you can physically grow one), which still has to be trimmed and kept neat (god help you if you let food drip down your chin into it).  You’re also limited in acceptable clothing and hair styles.  Color palette is more limited, as are the type of garments, and in most jobs, hair must be kept short by policy. 
 Being a larger person physically has some distinct disadvantages as well.  If you’re not tall, you have an extra hard time with society.  If you’re tall, much better time socially, and sure, you can reach stuff on higher shelves, but you hit your head on things or regularly have to duck.  Like all the time. Longer bones mean less leverage too, so if you’re not inherently muscle bound, you look even weaker than if you were a smaller person. Balding also really sucks, as I understand it, but I’m personally too young/lucky to have experienced that. 
 Testosterone is very much a double edged sword.  It allows for greater size and strength and muscle mass (desirability of those things is up to opinion), but it also causes, in most cases, a strong and spontaneous libido that sometimes gets in the way, and can make men more prone to aggression. 
 Women are restricted in their hobbies and interests, primarily by social factors now, but the same can definitely be true of men.  If a guy likes knitting, rom-coms, flowers, stuffed animals, nail polish and cats, and is employed as a nurse or a typist, imagine how society would judge him, even if he has a wife and kids.  And if a guy likes kids, and wants to be a babysitter, daycare worker, or preschool teacher, he is likely at some point to be thought of as, or even called to his face, a pedophile.  If you don’t feel strong, if you feel emotional, if you’re overwhelmed and stressed out or lack self confidence, you’re told to ‘man up’ or ‘grow a pair’. You don't get to feel those things.  You're not really supposed to feel anything, and if you do, you need to bottle it up.  Actual  expression of negative emotions by men is very rarely supported. 
 So yeah.  It sucks over here in this camp too.",2681,"Grass is always greener, I suppose.",35,0.7259131073951721,0.001294681802392,0.0106379268690943,0.0001008854742394,0.3700443208217621,0.0001689584169071,0.0056228428147733,0.0001110271041397,0.3349636197090149,0.0002096562675433,0.09809560328722,0.0001763259933795,"Being a dude isn’t all its cracked up to be either.

"Excuse me for shitty english but so here’s what happened.  I was hanging out with my friend and these 3 gypsies were walking near us.  One of them starter to tell me things like „you look like a girl“ and stuff so i just told him that he is a dick.He immediately started fight but his friends seperated us a said that we are not going to fight in a street because someone might call police.  I was pissed at him so when he told me that if i want to fight him in a secluded place i stupidly agreed.  We found a secluded place and agreed that we will just grapple or wrestle and dont punch or kick.  I won in like 15 seconds because he was a skinny guy and i got some wrestling training.  After the fight his friends said that now we are cool and they will not harrase me again.  He said that he was impressed at how i fight and he wanted to go on a one round with me.  Again i stupidly agreed but after like 30 secs my friend separeted us without explanation.  Later i found out that the first guy punched me in the back while i was fighting with the second guy and then my friend pushed him away but i didnt even noticed the punch.  After the fight we shook hands and my firend goes to shop to buy some water.  But while i was outside waiting for him one of those guys told me that he wants me to show him how to escape armbar.  So i stupidly let him put me into armbar and then when i was about to show him how to escape, his other friend goes behind me and starts to rapidly punching me to the back.  Luckilly i escaped armbar and ran away and called the police.  Im so fucking bad at running that i broke my foot while running away from them.  When i got home i realised that it was kinda cowardly that i was stronger than both of them.  And basically i ran and called a police on one skinny and fat guy that didnt even knew how to fight and i could probably beat them but because of my low blood pressure i was so fucking out of breath that i could not do otherwise.  Now i feel like a coward for running away and calling a police and stupid because a believed a gipsy would go on a fair fight and because the injury i got was a broken foot and i did it myself.  And i probably cannot go to certain places in town because when you call a police on a gipsy you will anger all his relatives.I have nothing against gipsies but many of them attack you for no reason.  I just want to know what you guys think about this, i know that im stupid but what troubles my mind is that feeling that i could maybe take them and not feel like a weak coward from running away from a bunch of thugs.Sry for english again.

"Ok, I can do that. 
 SO, same dude, same place. The World Series was over, and they were doing the usual post game stuff. You know, I wanna thank my Mom, God, my pusher and bitches. Anyway, same asshat is drunk off his ass, and pissed 'cause his team lost. Now, as part of the agreement for paying the cable bill, we get to set times we want to watch tv. That was the same night that the Hugh Heffner Roast was on Comedy Central, right after the game. I tell this dude that, you know, games over, changing the channel to the Roast. He gets in my face, screaming and cussin me out. I don't care, I tell him back down, and get to bed, he's drunk. He starts throwing out crap about me being Hispanic, and I try to blow it off, but the situation is starting to irritate me. 
 Description time: I'm a heavy set dude, with muscle to spare, and the asshat is a skinny white dude, maybe 130 sopping wet. One thing you don't do, is rear up on a Hispanic, look him in the eyes, and challenge him. I wanted to clean the cobwebs out of his head for him, but I stood down, and tried to be the bigger man, since he was drunk. SO, I made my only mistake. I pushed him off me, and turned my back to him. Dude grabs a heavy ceramic coffee mug off the counter, and clocks me upside the head. I went down to my knees, and sat there for a bit. Bear in mind, he knocked me out, and I don't remember the next part, my bud that was there told me what happened. He says I went from on my knees, to standing with this dude by the neck in one hand, and shaking him like a doll. Then I rear back and toss him into his room, following him in and start stomping the hell out of him. I come back out, and stand at the kitchen sink trying to pull it together. As a final vent, I smash my fist in the well of this stainless steel sink, and bend the hell out of it. 
 This is where I came to, wondering why I hurt so much. I'm looking around, seeing blood spurts on the walls, the ceiling, and pretty much every where. I figured out it was me bleeding when I put my hand to my head and pulled it back covered in blood. My buddy hustles me out of there, calling the cops at the same time. They forced me to head to the ER, cause I looked like I just walked out of a zombie flick, covered in blood. Dude was busted for assault and possession of alcohol on state property, since the College was a state facility. Dude's Dad payed for a get out of jail free card for him, so nothing happened really, even though I pressed charges. According to the skuttlebutt, the next year he was busted with so much drugs, that it was intent to distribute on state property. Daddy couldn't make that go away.

I did ask you some questions in my earlier posts to which I received zero replies making me think you're not even reading my comments, just skimming through at best, so of course I'm going to resort to educated guesses. 
 From your posts and they way you argue I am 90% certain you're an American. So here I am, once again in an argument over my country with a spoiled man-child, that believes due to his ""nationality"" and higher education (which university did you go to, I'm personally a UofOregon alumni getting my masters at Mcgill starting Fall) you obviously know better than someone from the 3rd world. I've met countless people like you that read dumb shit on the internet or watch some biased shit on TV and form their absolute opinions on the matters. 
 How about you come visit India and Pakistan? See for yourself how wrong you are. My facts? Just go through the thread and see how many Indians are supporting this tournament, isn't that enough?

I applaud your irrefutable logic. 
 You seem to think using fancy vocabulary and writing the same thing in three paragraphs makes you smart, when in fact you just keep proving to me how retarded you actually are because you can't even understand what I'm trying to say. 
 If you go back and actually read what I wrote instead of skimming through it you dumb ass, you might see that I already mentioned there is unrest between the two countries at the political level but no obviously you didn't read a single word the ""Paki"" wrote so here you are embarrassing yourself once again. 
 Do you believe I care what another fat American thinks of my country and myself? No sir, I don't give two shits about you or your negativity and hateful comments. You are ignorant which is why I stepped up to try to explain to you that ""No, this hate cycle between the two countries is ancient history now. The youth is enlightened and we are much more tolerant."" and you say I'm living in a utopia/Narnia lol. Then when I get pissed off at you for saying that and flame you back you resort to an anger and hate filled post that is repeating the same shit from your previous posts.

"first off, videogames/internet/tv/etc, these things are not addictive...rather, they are compulsions, a very minute but key distinction to make 
 addictions fuck with your brain chemistry, they act independently and can fuck you up just as bad when you try to stop taking them as they did when you started 
 compulsions are dependent, they act as a shelter from some deep seated flaw within your psyche...its a hiding place, a comfort zone that your mind has programmed itself to turn to when faced with adversity 
 so what needs to happen to tackle such a thing is this...find out your hidden flaw and tackle that, not the stimuli itself...working out and eating healthy are the go to as most people who find themselves under these compulsions have self-esteem issues and view their physical persona negatively...the newfound looks and energy are what kick them back into shape if they are able to stick with it 
 but its not the case for everyone...personally, i had problems connecting with people...as an introverted soul, some teenage angst had me hating the world, or rather the people in it, and i became a shut in with no outside connection for a long long time....i subscribed to the pickup artist movement for my confidence and motivation boost ( /r/seduction  if you dont know what im talking about and want to stay within reddit to find out) 
 for you it may be difference...no one can really help you until you do some serious soul-searching and find out your personal everest 
 from there, its about finding a routine that you enjoy and connecting it back to this problem...for me, it was forcing myself to talk to a random girl every day and to be proactive in getting my friends together at least once every weekend...this was the routine, this gave me confidence, this pulled me from a slump (this and getting a job where i was forced to interact with tons of people on a daily basis) 
 it could be anything...you like building stuff? build something new every week, build a tv stand to replace that crappy one you have, build a new chair, build a lamp, whatever...just make it a goal to build something every week or two or whatever 
 furthermore, once something like this gets severe enough, the internet/videogame compulsion can somewhwat take a life of its own...its generally best to go cold turkey in these cases, as much as possible in todays technology age...force yourself to just turn it off and go do something

"I need to scream into a void. Sorry you guys had to hear/read this. 
 
 Husband is out of town. AGAIN. 
 
 He actually invited me and baby to tag along in the hotel room for a change of pace since it's maybe an hour and a half away. Turns out, the hotel is shitty and he doesn't really want the 3ish month on to stay there. It's on an awesome scenic lake with hills and whatnot, but alas. On top of that the weather is supposed to be severe tomorrow hampering any attempt at driving up there with baby. 
 
 I live in a state with about 2 weeks of proper Spring before a famously shitty & swampy summer. Our two weeks must fucking be up because attempting to use AC now that weather's climbed above 80 was a joke. We don't have enough money to fix it, so here's hoping our ancient box fans hold until we can pay for repairman to at least look at it next week. 
 
 Needed a breather today, so I called in laws to watch baby. Of course some bogus shit pops off and my MIL invites random new neighbors to touch all over baby while I'm not in eyeline. I heard one of them say ""I work in a medical office"" with a smile and that's when I GTFO. 
 
 On the drive home, I pull over to answer call from Favorite Aunt. Her oldest daughter is in ICU thanks to massive gastro blood loss. I can't leave baby with in laws anymore this week (and why would I want to with all this fucking inconsiderate bullshit popping off) & I'm not carting LO around a hospital with an RSV outbreak. 
 
 Get home, let dogs out. FIL left the goddamn fucking side gate wide open at our house when he invited himself over to get something out of the shed while I was out. So smallest dog fucking bolts and I am strapping a teething baby onto me as I look all around the neighborhood. She finally came running back 30 minutes later from under neighbor's deck. Fuck me. 
 
 Baby takes first solid bottle since nearly noon and stops screaming for a few seconds. Decide I will tuck into the Easter candy husband hasn't devoured yet. IT WAS SO HOT IN MY HOUSE WHILE I WAS OUT THAT IT IS FUCKING MUSHY. 
 
 An hour later, of course other dog fucking gets out. As I'm in the back yard calling for her with just a shirt on, a dude says ""HEY HELLO"" from out of the fucking darkness. He's not one of my neighbors. I couldnt get a good look. I said ""I'm looking for my dog"" and he didn't say anything back. I called 911 on my phone. Cops came and have car parked at end of road now. 
 
 
 Good fucking lord, today.

"I've known for a while that my mother is a total nmom. She has all the classic ""It's the ME show 24/7"" characteristics. But I was wondering if anyone else has experience with a particular part of her that has always bugged me the most. She is incredibly strict about rules. She has thousands of them around the house and to this day - I am 29 - I must follow them at all costs. These rules change all the time and are rarely fully explained. They aren't ever really logical either. Now, when these rules are broken - generally because they were never fully explained, they changed or just seemed fucking crazy - she acts like you have done this on purpose just to hurt her. 
 I'll give you an example for clarity. My mother has a ton of rules about proper bathroom usage. Your bath time should not extend thirty minutes, you cannot take a bath and wash your hair while you're in the bath because that water is dirty. You must fully drain and clean the bath and then kneel next to it and wash your hair as you dangle it over the side of the bathtub. She listens for the sound of the bathtub draining so she knows whether or not you have done so. You have to go downstairs anyway because wet towels - and you can only use one towel per bath - MUST go on the downstairs heater to dry before they go into the laundry. 
 You cannot drip in the bathroom nor is it permitted to get the bathmat wet. You must fully drain the tub while you're still in it, wipe yourself down with a towel and then, once dry, step out of the bath and onto the bathmat. Woe betide you if you drip anywhere in the bathroom. She has about a thousand bath products around the edge of the bath but they are HER products and hers alone. You must use the generic kind in the cupboard next to the sink on the other side of the bathroom. So if you forget to get the giant bottle out before you get into the bath your options are to drip on the floor and piss her off or to use her products and piss her off. 
 I could go on and on about her many rules but what gets me is that when there is so much as a single drop of water on the floor, she will generally - I say generally because she likes to mix it up - have a fit. She will scream at you about what an unbelievably inconsiderate bitch you are and how you absolutely did this just to spite her and how dare you do something so horrible to her when she has provided for you all of her life. 
 I was just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences because let me tell you, people don't believe me when I tell them shit like this. And I'm also wondering... Are all these rules designed just to trip you up so she has something to yell at you for? Because it's always felt like that to me.",2710,"Nmom makes tons of rules, doesn't explain then acts personally slighted when rules are broken, is this on purpose?",114,0.8434537649154663,0.0008331247372552,0.0297812353819608,0.0001057530826074,0.6992090940475464,0.0001828991080401,0.0286363940685987,0.000111249355541,0.4648447632789612,0.0001766859932104,0.0324369147419929,0.0001312673994107,"My mother is incredibly strict about rules.

"your psychiatrist sucks. period.  I have fought major depression/anxiety since elementary school and only in the last four years sought help because I got myself in a lot of trouble with reckless behavior.  Anti-depressants are only really effective for a small percentage of people while it is agreed that talk/cognitive therapy is the best course for everyone.  I still take antidepressants  because mine levels off my anxiety attacks, but now is the best I've felt as long as I can remember. 
 I wasn't intensely suicidal, but I had plans in place or would drink and drive just to see if that would be the day I went.  I tried to drink myself to death for a while.  I drove wrecklessly at night and wrecked my car when a deer jumped out.  I slept around with women I had no interest in.  I picked fights all the time and my temper was out of control for years.  Couldn't keep a job because I couldn't deal with the people for more than a few months.  I would get myself buried in debt and then regret and try to climb out.  the list goes on and on and nobody but me knew I was this way because I pretended to be happy most of the time. 
 I went through over a year of counseling and probably will go back for more because there is simply a lot of distorted thoughts floating around in my head still.  I am able to finally put many things in perspective though.  Also I highly recommend working on looking at yourself objectively and working on correcting thoughts you know deep down are warped. 
 if you seek a therapist/psychiatrist/counselor NEVER settle.  I went through a few before I found those I felt I could trust and clicked with correctly.  keep perspective and understand that it's a long, long process and there will probably always be bad days but they will pass.  Almost forgot; AVOID TRIGGERS. BAD NEWS, SAD/ANGRY TOXIC PEOPLE, ANYTHING.  SEEK OUT HAPPY SHIT and things that make you feel good.  I rescued two ducks and  those dorky bastards are my happy place. 
 I have also been single for a year and a half and I don't know if its the pills or fear, but I have little to no attraction to anyone anymore for more than a fleeting moment.  Also still working on getting friends but it's a slow process.  I take 20mg Citalopram (generic Celexa i think) and see a psychiatrist every three months.  I got a cat, dog, and other pets and I can tell you they add a lot to life.  There are a lot of outreach programs out there and places to get cheaper/free counseling.  My counselor was an intern and didn't cost a dime but she was super supportive.  Don't discount interns lol.

"Seriously? Memes get delegated to self posts and you guys throw a huge tantrum. I can't see any good reason to get mad over this besides the fact that you guys will lose out on imaginary internet points: memes are still there, you just don't get karma for them. Also, complaining about mods being ""dictators""? Get over yourselves. This a fucking internet forum, not someone declaring martial law in the U.S. 
 ""But the content of a subreddit should be determined democratically through upvotes and downvotes!"" 
 Disregarding the fact that you can  still submit memes , relying solely on upvotes/downvotes works in favor of stupid, lowbrow, ""instant lulz"" humor or sensationalist news stories. You could upvote 20 memes in the time it takes you to read a well thought out self post and upvote it. 
 ""But freedom of speech!"" 
 Moderators have the right to do what they will on a privately owned internet site. It has been proven time and time again, in subs such as /r/history and /r/askscience that good discussion can not simply appear out of thin air in a subreddit, especially one with a large amount of subscribers; strict moderation is the only way to ensure on-topic discussion. 
 ""But memes help convert people to atheism!"" 
 Really? /r/atheism is about converting people to atheism through stupid low brow humor that doesn't actually raise intelligent questions about faith but simply chooses to mock it or point out irrelevant factual inaccuracies? I'm sure you guys are totally in support of christians trying to convert people to their belief system, right? 
 ""But the Christians are getting their way!"" 
 It's absolutely ridiculous to me to that you guys believe that these new rules are the result of christians lobbying to ""shut down your freedom of speech"". This is  exactly  the same kind of petty self-victimization that you see all the time in news reports about ""the war on christmas"" or ""war on religion"". Don't you guys realize how stupid it is to assume that christians on reddit are somehow directly responsible for something you don't like? Most of the backlash against /r/atheism comes from people who are themselves atheist, and it's not because they dislike the beliefs, it's because /r/atheism skirts intelligent, mature discussion in favor of dumb, pointless attacks on organized religion. 
 It's also worth pointing out that memes have already been banned in a number of subreddits other than /r/atheism; the aim was not to restrict ""freedom of speech"" but to encourage higher quality content; I guess you guys are above that. 
 Anyway, just realize how absolutely fucking retarded it is to get so worked up over  fucking delegating memes to self posts.

"I'm a grown ass man.  23 years old.  I make my own money, pay my own bills and wipe my own ass.  Sometimes my dick gets hard.  Has for a while now.  I know how to take care of it when it does. 
 Problem being, I've been using the same method to relieve that penile pressure for about a decade now.  Sometimes my mind would wonder.  Sometimes it would think, ""Hey now, IRefuseToGiveAName, you think there's a better way we could do this?"" 
 So I put some words into that Google box, and by god, there's another way to pull your pud... and it doesn't even involve pulling!  I hopped on to Amazon and ordered that baby with two day shipping. 
 Now there I was, on a Sunday night, going to bed with the image of ribbed pleasure dancing in my head.  ""Tuesday was going to be a great day,"" I thought to myself as I faded out of consciousness. 
 So I wake up today (Monday) with a text from my mom.  Nothing unusual.  Well, it turns out she used my Amazon account once (for dat der prime), and her Email got tossed into the mix at some point.  She sends me a screenshot of my shipping confirmation with a tag ""lololololol"" on it (never should have taught my mom to use the internet). 
 My face turned red, I got a little embarrassed, but whatever.  I'm a man, I have needs.  No need to make too big of a deal out of this.  So I didn't.  We talked, she asked me if I was okay on money, and we're going to go have dinner next week.  My mom's awesome. 
 THEN COMES THE TEXT FROM MY GIRLFRIEND. 
 I left my Amazon logged into my girlfriend's computer, and she just so happened to be looking for a book this morning.  Well, I was checking to see if I accidentally missed the option for next day shipping (I'm an impatient bastard), so I popped another one into my cart and checked on it.  Never took it out.  It was there this morning, and I received the wrath of a million suns. 
 My girlfriend as somehow under the impression that I do not masturbate.  I was somehow that ONE guy who isn't lying when I say ""oh, I don't do that"" (which, by the way, I never did).  So we got into one of the biggest arguments I've ever had.  The biggest we've had by far.  She was livid, I was confused, the whole thing was a fucking blur to be quite honest.  Things were said, feelings were hurt, and it ended okay. 
 We're over it now, I'm returning it as soon as it arrives.  Not because she's making me, but because that fucking thing is going to be tainted with the memories of this argument... and I'm not sure if I'll ever really be able to fully get over the fact that my mom KNOWS I have it, or at least that I know that she knows that I have it.

 Sunava bitch , I hate when this happens. I can't tell you how many times I've had to restart TTs and license tests because my stupid ass just has to get gold/first on everything.  Ah gad, I have to get dat gold! 
 Hands down one of the confoundingly hardest things I've had to do in any video game was the Top Gear challenge in GT5 where you go around the test track in the Lotus Elise 111R, following a line of cars of the same make and model, and the ultimate goal obviously is to get first. 
 2 laps.... 
 starting in last(12th place).... 
 in a car that handles like the baddies from the fucking oil slick fight scene in Transporter. 
 You think you know the meaning of frustration? Prepare to get shit on by that Polyphony staff member who fucking designed this stage, who clearly was having a bad day at the office and wanted to say ""Fuck you."" The depths of his evil have no measure. He might as well be the one to usher in the Fourth Reich. 
 I can't tell you the countless hours I poured into attempting this maddening ordeal, only to be met each time with failure. I came close a few times and had a few missed chances. It felt horrible when I realized I had let the win slip from my grasp. The game disqualifies you when you touch a cone(even if it had been knocked over previously by an NPC car). You get DQ'd if you bump another car moderately, let alone ever so slighty tapping one in certain sections of the course. There are a couple invisible walls that jut out slightly into the racing line, which to avoid is easier said than done if you aren't paying careful attention when trying to worry about the upcoming corner, your placement for the line you want to take, and the proximity of the aforementioned NPC cars that are protected like they are made of fine goddamn china. The race requires the utmost precision and execution in order to succeed. Fall out of sequence one bit, and you lose the win. This race will destroy your hopes and dreams. 
 But oh, that moment that finally came when I conquered it; how it was so sweet. I was ecstatic, bewildered, and sad all at the same time. I went and splurged on a Wendy's Baconator afterwards, and goddamnit, that was the best friggin' Baconator I've ever had. 
 I thought putting the game down after that would make sense, like an athlete or an actor bowing out in their prime. But no, I soldier on with the game and right now, here I sit, in a calmly lit living room with an adequate Christmas tree, listening to the smooth jazz of the GT5 menu music beckon me to push myself that much more,  to play just one more race.",2726,"Challenges are good for your self-progress and that I'm a petty, anal completionist.",84,0.8713163733482361,0.2616195678710937,0.0396650694310665,0.000815583160147,0.8085290789604187,0.0664730593562126,0.0316073074936866,0.0005055570509284,0.4789410233497619,0.013800723478198,0.0324468240141868,0.0010699088452383,"Hands down one of the confoundingly hardest things I've had to do in any video game.

 Racism has adverse effects on the race that isn't the dominant group... You can't really be racist against white people unless whites are poorest or in the minority in the particular area you're in, effectively. You may be trying to satirize a prissy PC person trying to protect the dignity of a marginalized group (fuck them, right?), but you're being kind of dumb. Having an edgy opinion isn't all that special when you don't have a good reason for the edgy opinion. 
 ""Redneck"" is a term for poor Southern whites. In the west coast we'd call the same group ""hippies"" or ""white trash/trailer trash,"" the only difference being the political affiliation. It isn't quite the same as the term ""nigger,"" which is a derisive nickname given to black Americans, especially during reconstruction. People chased down black Americans and lynched them shouting, ""Nigger!"" People spat in faces of black Americans and forced them out of their seats in restaurants and buses saying, ""Nigger!"" ""Nigger,"" as a term one white person calls one black person, says a lot of things. It says, ""You will never be more than a black person, which is always inferior to me, a white person."" See, the social dynamics of the situation mean a black person can't say, ""Honkey!"" or ""Whitey!"" back at you, because there is no social consequence for being white. But there is a social consequence for being black, and it is imposed on a black person. The word ""nigger"" points it out and mocks the individual for forgetting it. 
 Now that the term is a hilarious greeting for /b/tards and twelve-year-olds on xbox live, I guess white people are gradually forgetting this legacy. And good for them! Because that's how racism dies, right? The racists just bring new social meaning to it while denying it exists. Teehee! 
 But I suppose a lot of black people lynched poor whites and yelled, ""Redneck!"" at them? It's all the same, right? Same kind of social alienation? Just as offensive? 
 If you do some reading on race relations (I recommend Dubois'  Reconstruction ), you'd find that the reason racism exists is due to class conflict. The people described as ""rednecks"" began to ally themselves with poor black folk to demand economic equality from the rich. The rich then invented and promoted the idea of racial superiority to divide the lower class -- white people, no matter how destitute, were  at least  white. As we can see, the plan worked. The plan continues to work. When us prissy PC types tell you to quit using racial slurs and racist language, we're trying to stop that bullshit.",2771,No. You're not clever.

"My God, I've been sitting here for an hour. Summarizing my four-year story into a few long-sentenced passages is... challenging. 
 I've never been good with beginnings, and I suppose there're several ways to being this. Option #1, five years ago. A thirteen-year-old fella falling in love with the most beautiful brown-headed girl in Tel Aviv. Some luck has made their paths cross and spend a few weeks together. Best fucking weeks of his youth. Worst fucking breakup. 
 He's been dreaming about her ever since. Four years of a growing depression, memories, anxiety, burning his goddamn throat, and producing more tears than sperm cells. Life sucks. 
 This fella is almost a soldier now, and he even has a little beard that reminds everyone of a Spanish pornstar but generally, he's pretty. 
 Last month he began talking with another girl. That's the second beginning. It wasn't the first time he tried to restore a relationship that would be as the one he had, but this time it developed into something expectational. They talk every day. She laughs, she hears all about his talents, his passions, and eventually they meet. 
 God, this 3rd person thing is ridiculous. 
 So we meet. And I probably burned about a thousand calories the night beforehand. I wrote everything I feel about her. Every little thought of my mind, that's abnormally imaginative when I'm on the verge of tears.   I had my doubts, obviously. I just didn't want to fuck this up, goddamn it - I didn't want to be alone again. 
 We met, she thought it was great, I thought I was pathetic. I thought I fucked up. I sent her what I wrote about her, and stopped talking with her for a week. Eventually, I couldn't be alone anymore. I texted her. She says she loves me. I say I love her. We're together, and goddamn I burn a thousand calories every hour ever since. 
 I can't sleep. I can't study. I can't speak properly because I'm always anxious. At some point, I can't write anymore. Everything I text her is briefly examined, and the verdict is already obvious: It's the worst thing I could possibly text. 
 Nonetheless, I continue to be funny. Sometimes I'm still sad, and she knows that. She knows I'm fucking anxious and that I feel pathetic about myself. She knows, and she still fucking loves me. She does, the problem is - I don't trust it. I know I'm pathetic, I know everything I say is wrong and I'm always scared. 
 THE PROBLEM: I'm always scared. I wanna cry beneath the sheets and never wake up again. I wanna be alone, but in the long-term I know I don't. Actually, I don't know what I want. I know whatever I'm gonna do I'm gonna be anxious. We planned on meeting tomorrow, and I wanna say I can't. I wanna say I cheated on her and be fucking alone. Alone is safer, it's familiar. But It's wrong, isn't it?",2790,"I'm anxious screwing up, and wanna avoid my GF because of that.

"If you mean at graduation...meh, kind of shitty and surreal. Everything pretty much got canceled, but it didn't matter since most of our families didn't make it to see us. 
 If you mean what was it like when we found out about the attacks, I'll just paste in what i wrote on the ""where were you on 9/11"" post: 
 
 I was turning in my equipment as it was the day before my Army basic training graduation. It was kind of funny because as we were going through the various stations turning in gear we kept hearing whispers from the people who worked at the equipment depot. 
 >Did you hear, private, there was a bomb at the world trade center 
 then at the next station 
 >it wasn't a bomb, it was an airplane, and they just hit the pentagon. 
 then at the  next  station 
 >no no, it was  two  planes that hit the WTC and another plane that hit the pentagon and there's  another  plane still missing. 
 but of course, we were ignoring all of this because we just assumed they were fucking with us. They had already convinced us once that we were going to have to use atropine auto-injectors on ourselves (think huge spring loaded syringes) and that was bullshit, so this was just another joke they pulled on dumb privates before they leave for the next round of training. 
 When we were done turning in our gear we were all lounging out in front of the depot, and there was definitely a weird buzz in the air, but we figured it was us projecting our excitement to get the fuck out of Ft Sill. But then one of the Drill Sergeants comes out and calls us all into formation. When we're all lined up he starts screaming in classic DS Omer fashion: 
 >####ALL RIGHT PRIVATES, AS I'M SURE SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD, THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL. THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IS GONE AND THE PENTAGON IS IN FLAMES. LINE THE FUCK UP TO GO GET YOUR GEAR BACK, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT WHERE YOU'RE GOING. 
 [several moments of us staring at him slack-jawed] 
 >###JUST KIDDING, YOU'RE FUCKING PRIVATES. YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRAINED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? 
 [more slack-jawed staring] 
[he then continues, not screaming] 
 >No, but really, there has been an attack. We're still getting the details but both NYC and Washington have been struck. Make no mistake privates, we're going to war. 
 And then he just walked away without bothering to dismiss us. We just stood there in shock for a few minutes before another drill sergeant came to pull out those of us from NYC so we could get back to the barracks to get information on what was going on. 
 Fun fact: My parents were actually flying out of NYC to see me graduate while all of this was going down.

"I think there's a slightly more complex situation going on here, certainly with people under 35. And that situation is the attention whore. 
 We've all known a female attention whore. She's the male equivalent of the frat boy bragging about his sexual conquests. This is a woman who uses sex or the promise of sex as a tool for getting attention. 
 The presence of said attention whore leads to a massive conflict for me and I think loads of other women around my age and in a similar situation. On one hand, I applaud any woman who is open about their sexuality and liking sex. I fucking love having sex and have no problem initiating it if I want it. I've had relationships and a few one night stands, the one-nighters are generally not for me but so what? If you want to sleep around with dozens of people, once you're happy and safe, more power to ya. 
 But when  some  women do it, they don't seem happy at all. They seem pathetic and insecure. Sex has no longer become a means of pleasure and empowerment but rather a last desperate attempt to get some kind of affection. 
 I know a group of girls like this, they're a bit younger than me and it's actually really fucking sad. They like to come across as ""we're really cool and open and relaxed"", they pretend it doesn't bother them when their ex-boyfriend immediately gets into bed with their 'best friend', they even offer a 3-some etc etc, but instead have massive fights with all their friends over the pettiest details, because it just wouldn't be cool to actually admit you're hurt over something to do with sex. 
 A lot of these girls don't tend to have long-lasting relationships, not a bad thing at all when you're that age. But they seem to be jealous of other girls who do. If a break-up happens within their group, instead of being supportive, one or two of them will instantly try to come on to the ex-boyfriend, it seems to me like some kind of validation. Or they'll be at a party and get naked and kiss some of their other female friends, not because they're the least bit bi but because they love the attention of the drooling 20 year old guys there. 
 These are  not  the women who represent the millions of women who are comfortable with their sexuality, instead they kind of wear it like ill-fitting clothes. But they have often become the face of it which is sad for the rest of us. 
 I'll also happily admit that I am a former attention whore which is part of the reason I don't put up with any of this bullshit. From 17-18 I had a brief period of it (posting pics of myself on the internet etc, not sleeping with my friends exes) and seriously, it's usually not about liking sex or being open, it's about a stupid little girl wanting to know she's better looking than the other stupid little girls because it's the only thing that will make her feel better about herself.",2850,there's a difference between sexually confident women and attention whores and this could be part of the reason women get more flak,131,0.6997150182723999,0.8714215755462646,0.015804998576641,0.0151088023558259,0.5990676879882812,0.4370562732219696,0.004761267453432,0.0033804785925894,0.2013779282569885,0.3767616152763366,0.0424641370773315,0.1237372606992721,We've all known a female attention whore.

"She's narcissistic and a raging bitch. I've been with her son (the baby) for seven years and we've lived down here (~3000 miles away from her) for five and a half years. 
 I've largely been no contact with her for the last 2.5 years, and that's worked for us as she chose not to visit. However, about a year ago, older BiL and his family of five moved down here. MiL has visited twice in the last seven months because now there are grandkids here. 
 I've managed not to see her every time she's come down to visit. The mister spends the majority of the time when she's here spending time with her. I get that, and I don't hold it against him. She's aging and morbidly obese, and she's his mother. No matter how awful she is, he still loves her. And that's okay. 
 I still struggle with feelings of belonging. When we moved down here, I became the awful one for ""stealing her baby away,"" and she has pretty successfully turned the rest of the family against me. 
 My partner is amazing. He's the love of my life and I wouldn't trade him for the world. We're pretty deliriously happy. He's done everything from calling his mom names to demanding apologies for her behavior, from threatening to cut contact (his brothers threatened to cut him off completely, so that didn't go well) to trying to sit down and analyze her feelings about me. Nothing has worked. My problem is not with him or his lack of trying. 
 She has made it very clear she wants nothing to do with me. In fact, when she was in town several months ago, she said seeing me would ""ruin her vacation."" We actively tried to repair that relationship on our end, and she won't have it. I feel like I've done pretty much everything I could possibly do. 
 I've come to terms with the fact that I will never have a close relationship with his family, and especially with his mom. That is sad to me because my mom and I are really close, and I consider her to be one of my best friends.

 I have vented some on /r/raisedbynarcissists. While he recognizes his mom ""has issues,"" he's not ready to face that she likely has a personality disorder (or many symptoms of one, since there isn't an official diagnosis), so it's difficult to approach my frustration with him from that angle. 
 Those of you with awful in-laws, how do you do it? It hurts that I can't have a close relationship with these people I thought would be like family to me. Do you have suggestions for me to work through my own feelings without burdening my partner with more mom issues?

"I just read ""TIFU by sneezing while wiping my ass."" and it reminded me of something that happened to me about a year ago, although just vaguely related and nowhere near as bad. 
 I'd been working at my job for a couple of months, and was invited out for drinks with my co-workers. I had been hitting it off with a pretty cute girl who worked in my department, and as the night came to an end, we decided to go home to her place. She lived with this very gossipy mutual colleague of us, but we didn't mind since most people at work already knew we left the bar together. Everything went pretty well, but the morning after I had a terrible hangover. My stomach was pushing for gold and glory in both directions, and eventually I faced the fact that I had to take a dump before I could get home. I got out of the bed, and realized that no time was to be spared as my bowels felt like a poorly dammed up Niagra falls. I fled for the bathroom and the moment I sat down the dam broke and all kinds of yellow-ish, stinking horror splashed down, and then up on my cheeks again. It was very, very intense. My asshole burned brighter than Horatios hair. I almost threw up as the smell reached my nostrils. 
After about 20 minutes of excruciating pain and suffering, I felt a little better, so I thought I'd start wiping my ass. Now this is a standing procedure for me, there's just no other way. So I carefully pressure myself to a standing postion, boxers around my ankles, t-shirt right above my still-shrinking dick and balls from the nightmare my asshole just went through. Goosebumps all over, feeling like shit I started wiping my sore asshole. In the middle of the third wipe I got really nauseous for a moment and froze my whole body, waiting for the nausea to blow over. Standing there, with my right hand and some tp planted in my ass, desperately trying to feel better, I did what I usually do to improve my imediate situation, I jammed my left thumb up my nose and dug for gold. And gold I found! A huuge booger, just waiting for me to scrape it out, roll it into a neat little ball and split it with my nail. As I was focusing on the very important mission on how to get the whole booger out without leaving any fellow boogers behind, the bathroom door suddenly opened. Our mutual colleague froze immediately as she stared at me in utter disbelief. Me, standing there in the middle of the worst stench imaginable, with my shrunken manhood clearly visible under my t-shirt, wiping my ass with one hand while pulling out a trophy booger with the other, really had nowhere to go or anything to say. I was doomed. She eventually gathered herself and slammed the door. I rushed out of the appartment faster than all the fucks and used the rest of the weekend feeling very, very sorry for my self.

"So...shit. First off this one is disgusting. 
 So I had these two lumps on my penis kinda hard and white, I looked it up online and it appeared they were filled with pus and were basically spots and it said they should disappear in a week or so... 3 months later they were still there in all their glory. Now I had been seeing this girl and thought these lumps would be such a turn off they might think its an STD or something. So I decided what do you do with a pimple? You pop it... yeah. I couldn't find a needle so I had to settle with a pocket knife, I dipped the blade into an antiseptic first then surgery began. Sat on the toilet wielding a knife about to stab my dick. I assumed a little prick (not talking about my dick) with the blade would do the job and I could squeeze the pus out, well the lump was way tougher than that and it hurt like fucking hell! I kept stabbing at it but couldn't even puncture the skin, I started to contemplate what I was doing with my life sitting with my trousers around my ankle trying to slice my sausage with a blunt blade. So eventually with a good thrust I managed to stab that fucker there was blood leaking everywhere; all over my hands, the knife and most importantly my dick. ""Now I can just squeeze this fucker!"" Nope blood was just squirting all over my hands and that white lump was not moving, I even started feeling faint from blood loss. I had gone too far to give up now though! I put the blade back in through the small hole I had made and then angled it so it came back up through the skin, I could see the outline of the knife coming up on the skin as it pulled up and I just had to go for it and I sliced a good centimeter of skin open on the shaft of my penis. Blood... so much blood but there was also this white substance coming out! yes it was happening! I squeezed my dick like I was trying to get the last bit of ketchup out a packet and let me tell you I had to squeeze that fucker hard. Eventually I got the last fucking bit out and it was hard to tell seen as my dick was now caked in blood, rinse and repeat for lump 2.... yep I did this  twice. 
 So that was actually a couple of days ago and my penis has been stinging like crazy since. I have been covering it in antiseptic every day which hurts like a bitch. Yet there is now a disgusting hole where I gouged out a part of my dick and it oozes  pus... yep real nice right? So then today this girl wanted to meet up and I wasn't going to turn her down was I? So I show up and we are making out vigorously and then she goes for the trousers, just as she was pulling them down I remembered shit... I quickly pulled my trousers up awkwardly and made some shitty excuse. I think she now thinks I don't want sex... nope its just right now my dick stings like hell has a gash in it and oozes pus and blood but for once I think the truth was best left untold.",2877,"Cut dick up, pus and blood everywhere, still a virgin.",54,0.996073603630066,0.9956587553024292,0.3055257797241211,0.3084692656993866,0.9826574921607972,0.970397174358368,0.1099450439214706,0.2040497958660125,0.6200169920921326,0.5918737053871155,0.0117468973621726,0.0127435876056551,"""I had been seeing this girl and thought these lumps would be such a turn off they might think its an STD or something.

In the year three thousand and thirty,

 I must appeal to you people with your faculties,
Cuz everybody else is gonna laugh at me.
People try to get over and take a crack at me.
The universe is one and I can see what rap can be glorious
Put in the Smithsonian my podiums for holy hymns
But you see who's controlling them.
Fuck myself off cuz of the egotistical mode I'm in.
No I can't slap you no five,
When you and your cutty is talkin shit about me outside.
People take pride in what they have no hand in.
Sorta like a phantom holographic handsome.
But deep inside he wants to do what his man done.
Just because his peers jeer and and clown,

So many rules and regulations say you're not allowed.

Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens,
I smoke herb and rock a turban.

"Once again I'm so horny that vanilla isn't doing it for me, and even the moderately weird stuff isn't gonna work. I'm browsing weird porn, I'm reading old RPs, I'm literally dripping at the thought of being used by one or more of you. 
 On with the prompts! In all of these I'm definitely the submissive, but I'm happy to incorporate pretty much any additional kinks you want to bring to the table as well. Also mixing and matching is fucking great, let's do that! 
 
 Futa? Or any variant of girl with cock. I love these which is a trait I share with a lot of the guys on this sub, so the pretty but hung ladies are spoilt for choice. I'd recommend giving me a chance, I'm pretty fun. I'd you're open to suggestions futa that are physically stronger than men (hot) /but don't look it(hottest!). Maybe some bizarre incident means every girl on campus is suddenly packing the kind of dick that would intimidate a porn star and means to use it, maybe I stumble onto a hidden tribe of futa, maybe I somehow end up on a date with a gorgeous girl, not knowing she's a vampire but she won't be the one sucking? 
 
 Beast/monster stuff. Again I'm pretty easy on the partner but predators are always the most fun. Canine is popular, tentacles could be fun and I love the sexually aggressive monster trope. Minotaur, werewolves, orcs, ogres, dragons, anything! 
 
 Alpha Males. Not just quite masculine guys, and not just the shouting or bullying some people think makes you a dom. I mean guys who are so male that everyone looks and feels feminine around them. Not just arrogant but self assured. It's a weird one but I love stories/settings where this is inherent - alpha males secretly run the world, or are an invading, unstoppable force, or aren't even human - I think my love for monsters stems from the same thing. 
 
 Male Pregnancy or MPreg for those who spend as much time in terrible places on the 'net as me. It makes sex risky, it adds a whole element of domination, it means that you're doing more than just marking me with your cum... it's just great. I don't know why, but it's just amazing 
 
 
 Kinks, which are always important. My only limit is toilet stuff, so feel free to incorporate anything else. However : 
 
 Anal is hotter, more degrading and more feminizing than oral. Being roughly fucked by a real man is the best 
 
 younger or smaller tops that are physically more powerful - whether it's monstrous, superhuman or just how things are. Especially unstoppable futa. 
 
 non consent that turns the sun out. The kind of scene where there's a natural transition from fear or begging you to stop, to squealing with pleasure and begging you to never stop. 
 
 Huge cock on my partner, accompanied by size comparison, humiliation and dirty talk. Not so much unrealistic,unless there are other unrealistic elements. 
 
 also the old standbys of age play, incest, feminization, raceplay",2900,"I'm fucked up, come fuck me",27,0.686949610710144,0.9956541061401368,0.0080352509394288,0.3110393583774566,0.5579167604446411,0.9901621341705322,0.0028848024085164,0.0065025226213037,0.1248942017555236,0.521984338760376,0.0124621009454131,0.0059787770733237,"I'm open to suggestions futa that are physically stronger than men (hot) /but don't look it(hottest!).

"I've never been in a talent show but your post reminded me of something. Credit to /u/Lifesnotperfect 
 There was a mentally handicapped kid at my all boys high school (we'll call him Jack). He was skinny and pale and was a loner, I always felt bad for the guy.
Some assholes (I'm guessing it was the 'cool kids' at the time) convinced him that fingering cats was the cool thing to do. Well, him being who he is went home and fingered his cat and came back the next day to tell the assholes/'cool kids' what he'd done.
They spread the word about Jack fingering his cat around the school and soon enough everyone knew about it. Some people felt bad for jack and kept quiet, whilst others would yell ""Hey Jack! Heard you got some pussy last night!"" and laugh like it was the best joke in the world. Fuckwits.
Anyway, at the end of the school year there's a talent show. There are students and their families and teachers all gathered around.
This kid in grade 10 finishes a guitar solo performace of pachelbel canon, and it was really amazing. I still remember him shredding away at the guitar like crazy. Kid had skills and tons of talent.
Anyway, the MC gets up (it was the performance arts teacher) and she announces the next act from... Jack.
The whole student body lets out a gasp in unison, and we all go dead quiet. You could've heard a bee fart in that room it was so dead silent. Out comes Jack onto the stage, and tucked under his arm is his cat. Fuck. Me. Dead.
We all knew what was going to happen, but no one dared to say a thing. The silence broke and people started to whisper to each other. ""What the fuck?!"", ""No fucking way"", ""Is he really going to...?"", ""Oh my God I thought that was a joke!"", ""Oh fuck this is so horrible... Someone stop him the poor guy.."".
The teachers had no idea and started shushing us all.
There Jack stood, under the limelight with his cat now standing on a table. The thing was incredibly well behaved I must say.
Jack was dressed as a magician, with the sequinned cape that glittered in the light and the top hat. He even had the wand.
Everyone was on the edge of their seat in anticipation.
Jack slowly lifted his cat's tail, inserted two fingers into his mouth and licked at them, and then inserted his fingers into the cat's anus.
A woman from the side of the hall screamed. The music stopped, the lights went on and poor Mrs. Barrington ran onto the stage and hauled poor Jack the fuck out of there.
The hall half erupted in laughter while the other half were shocked. Some students were telling the ones laughing off, that it'd gone too far, others telling others to shut the fuck up and not be such pussies.
Anyway, the show went on and jack was taken away into the back, who knows where.
We never saw Jack again. I honestly still feel so bad for him till this day. I wonder what happened to him and what he's doing now.
Jack, whereever you are mate, I hope you're okay.",2920,"mentally handicapped student fingers a cat in front of the school
Update: A lot of people are mentioning how there would have been rehearsals so I asked around, getting in contact with old friends who were also there to see what they know. I'm told that he came to Ms. Barrington who was in charge of the show, a couple of days before it was to be on, right after the final rehearsals and begged her to let him do a quick act.
I'm guessing she felt sorry for him and figured it couldn't be all that bad.
And good news, I heard Jack is doing okay now!! My friend got word that someone saw him working in a popular Australian retail electronics retail franchise (JB Hifi) and he seemed quite happy!

"First off, I'm a 22 y/o F living with my mom, and this happened on Wednesday. 
 It all started when I decided to take a shower... As I was in the shower I started thinking about my camping trip coming up where I will be gone for 15 days. When's started thinking about that I started thinking how I would be away from my girlfriend for the longest we have been apart, and also will be going the longest I've ever gone without sex. Well thoughts go on and I was thinking about sex with my girlfriend and how hot it is. At this point I'm SUPER horny and I know I'm not going to be getting any for a while. I decide that I should probably just masturbate when I feel the urge so when I'm gone I'll kinda have it out of my system, if you will, then come home and be with my girlfriend. 
 Anyways, I decide I'm going to go get my little pocket vibrator to use in the shower. I run to my drawer and get it and return and start off in the shower. Well as I'm getting warmed up I remember that my mom's shower has the shower head from my old bathroom. That shower head is detachable and has a great massage setting. So I decide since I should be home alone for a while to go and do the job with that in there; first fuck up . I turn off my shower and idiotically, set my vibrator on the bathroom counter; fuck up two. 
 I run to my moms bathroom and start doing my thing like crazy. I'm super into it because I think I'm gonna be alone for a while. I'm being loud, and I go on for a good while. Well, right at the end, durning my  loudest  part, like less than 2 minutes after, I hear a knock the door to my moms room.  WTF  at this point I'm freaking out. Either my mom is home, and she most likely heard me climax, or, there is a fucking polite stranger in my house. 
 After my brain cogs start working and realizing what just happened I freak out and slam the water off, jump out and grab the only towel I see, and pretty much run out of my moms room. The other bathroom in the house is to the immediate left from my moms door, and there she is, taking a piss. I lose it, because  MY VIBRATOR IS RIGHT BEHIND HER ON THE BACK OF THE COUNTER  holyshitmymomsawmyvibratorandheardmeclimaxinhershower. 
 At this point I just lose it. I see myself in the mirror and I am BRIGHT red. Not even just my face but my whole chest. (I'm extremely faire so when I blush it's super obvious) On top of that, when I get embarrassed I kinda forget how to talk and start laughing uncontrollably. So I'm just cracking up, bright red, trying to make excuses for why I was in her shower, ""Oh I was using  giggle  the shower massager  laugh  for my shoulder!"" My mom just looks like she knows exactly what happened but she tries to pretend like she didn't see/hear anything. Finally I just grab the vibrator from behind her, run in my room, and slam the door and hide until she goes out of the hallway. May not seem to bad, but I was completely mortified.",2925,"decided to use my moms shower to masturbate when I thought she wasn't home, mom saw my vibrator and heard me cum in her shower.

"Yay my very own linked submission! First let me say: I was tired as fuck yesterday, it was like 3am and I had just [failed miserably to do only 150 of these in 10 minutes]( with a 45 pound kettlebell. 
 
 Here's the thing (before I get accused of being a white cis male MRA activist or whatevs): I'm not white, and I'm not a men's right activist. I'm an egalitarian and have been since I was a young kid, as I grew up in a [Sikh]( household. 
 Although I will gladly acknowledge my privilege: I'm a male, I'm well educated, I grew up upper middle class, I'm not quite 1% rich, but definitely in the top 5% (mostly because my dad even to this day busts his balls and works 60 hours a week at his company at the age of 56, and he worked really hard to get the company set up). I even don't get shit for being an atheist ever (even among family, they're not crazy and understanding) because I live in Canada. Yeah, I even have Canadian privilege (yay free healthcare!). I'm also not bad to look at (I work out), and am generally well liked. So yeah a lot of privilege going on. 
 
 Here's a wikipedia excerpt about Sikhism if you're curious: 
 > Sikh teaching emphasizes the principle of equality of all humans and rejects discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, and gender. Sikh principles do not attach any importance to asceticism as a means to attain salvation, but stresses on the need of leading life as a householder. 
 That's why I referred to it as  eurocentric  feminism in my comment. All this  first wave, second wave feminism . 
 
 Now to address the part linked specifically : when I talk about feminist privilege, I'm talking about the fact that if you tell most people  right now  you're a feminist you'll usually end up with ""oh cool"", whereas back in the old days it'd be ""omg you crazy bra burning bitch, you just need a man in your life"". 
 Nowadays if you were to say ""I'm a men's right activist"" people would laugh in your face or make fun of you for it without even acknowledging the legitimate concerns that exist for many men (see: the comments section in this entire subreddit); even if a lot of the time some issues are blown way out of proportion (omg men never get custody of their childrenz! false rape!). 
 Really, all I'm asking is for a little less hate (and marginalizing) and a little more civility among people, is that so wrong? It's easier to educate and teach stupid/ignorant people than to get into shouting matches with them and mocking them. Educate those crazy MRA people, don't just go ""LOL YOUR FUCKT, BRAH!"" 
 
 Or instead mock people who take issue with male genital mutilation. How is it any different than female genital mutilation?! The answer is: it isn't really.

"no matter how much i improve in life, deep inside, i'll have a foot fetish. even if i am the most successful man in the world, i will be a man with a foot fetish. 
 i realized this 10 years ago. it has EATEN ME ALIVE from the inside out. when i was 10 and had no friends and fought with my parents every day, sometimes i'd jack off to fetish porn and then cry afterwards from the guilt. 7 years later, i am almost a fucking legal adult and i actually have a social life, and STILL, sometimes i jack off to fetish porn and then cry afterwards. i just did. 
 7 years of hating myself for it later, 1 year of doing something about that hate later, i still have this fucked up disease. i still jack off to feet. sometimes, not even nofap can understand. you're addicted, at least it's to normal stuff. 
 if i get exposed today, what will the world think? what will the people close to me think? i feel guilt every day hiding my disease from the world. every living moment i am deceiving my closest friends by making them think i'm normal. 
 it's been so many years, i don't know what to do. no therapy options, no one to talk to. everything else in life and fine and dandy. i move on. people move on and think i am a sociable and balanced person (of course i am deceiving them). 
 normal men and have a beer with their bros and look at sexy images of girls in football ads and get turned on. i get riled up by seeing flips flops in the summer. 
 i meditated for 50 GOD DAMN FUCKING MINUTES today. took TWO showers. read motivational stories from nofap about people who succeeded in cleaning themselves of fetishes. closed my eyes so i don't have to see sandals and flip flops walking home from the gym. (can you fucking believe it? this guy who you thought was normal and walked normal, in reality has to close his fucking eyes so he doesn't feed his foot fetish?) dodged a torrent of urge for the entire morning all the way to the afternoon. then here i am, at 8 PM, with a dick and semen in my hand. WHAT ELSE DOES THIS DISEASE WANT FROM ME? YOU TOOK AN ENTIRE TEENAGE YOUTH FROM ME ALREADY. 
 i mean, the anxiety about the fetish could be contributing and making recovery and abstinence even harder by making me resort to the fetish itself to relieve the anxiety. but still. 
 maybe, just maybe, one day, i can wake up a normal man, and have sex like normal man. the other possibility is...well frightening. 
 i'm supposed to catch up with a girl tomorrow, it's like a date-ish kind of thing. which is basically the main reason i wrote this entire post. the guilt is so incredibly overwhelming, i dress up nicely, smile, and take her to a restaurant, but as it has been for all these years, every time something good happens, i am reminded that all i am doing is deceiving the people that make these good things possible. all i am doing is deceiving her. what if things get serious? am i just supposed to play along like i am a fetish-free normal guy?",2950,"i have a fetish, keep relapsing to it, and i can't stop feeling guilty about it being the  night before a date  and I JUST FUCKING RELAPSED TO FETISH PORN, hiding the fact that i am an abnormal piece of shit from the world, especially to a girl i'm supposed to go on a date with in less than 24 hours.

"This is a really long story but it's worth it. 
 First date with new guy, happened last night. Was the first time we met in person and had only been talking for like two days.  Was originally going to go to a movie with this guy and some friends, friends suddenly say they have to go do something else but will meet us at the theater. 
 Guy and I decide we didn't even want to see that movie, stay at my place and watch Doctor Who instead.  I text my friends to tell them we aren't coming to the movie.  We watch some more random shows, then decide to watch Tropic Thunder. 
 20 min into the movie, something loudly bashes against my door, scares the fuck out of us, but then it's just silence. We calm down for a little bit... Then suddenly, the door handle is being slowly pushed down. WTF.  Guy gets up and looks out the peep hole and can't see anything. MORE WTF.  We sit back down... nothing happens for a while.  Then suddenly, more bashing against the door, door handle being crazily pushed up and down, and then BAM fucking rock thrown at my patio door, was so loud that it sounded like the window cracked.  We proceed to freak the fuck out, jump off the couch and grab kitchen knives before hiding in the bathroom. 
 I call 911, having a fucking heart attack, and am on the line with dispatch for at least 20 min while the cops are trying to find my apartment. During this 20 min, more rocks were thrown at my windows, and there is more knocking and jiggling of the door handle. Guy kind of guards me the whole time with knife in hand. 
 Cops finally show up, inspect my windows, walk around the buildings, don't see anyone outside anywhere and can't find any proof that we were telling the truth, they look at us like we are a couple of tards.  Tell us to keep the door locked and have a good night. 
 My friends then call us and I tell them what happened, they are like omg no way, we are on our way there right now.  I then force them to stay the night because I am scared as fuck. Guy also says he will stay the night with me.  We stay up, tell some ghost stories, talk about random stuff, then friends go to sleep on the floor and the guy and I go my bedroom.  Crazy adrenaline fueled ""omg we survived"" sexytime ensues for the next 5 hours, we never went to sleep.  Magical. 
 Morning comes, friends send me a text asking me to come out of my room.  I come out and they are like ""we have something to tell you.""  They then proceed to tell me the story about how all the crazy door bashing and rock throwing was them, trying to freak us out, and that when it was obvious we wouldn't open the window or door, they gave up and had walked back to their car, literally missing the cops by a minute. They apologize as much as they can and then leave. 
 I tell the guy the truth, he still stays with me the whole morning. We took a shower together and went out for brunch and he drove me to work.

 This source says that the raw wage gap in 2007 was 20.4 percent, but adjusted for such factors as and I cite: 
 >A greater percentage of women than men tend to work part-time. Part-time work tends to 
pay less than full-time work. 
 >A greater percentage of women than men tend to leave the labor force for child birth, child 
care and elder care. 
 >Some of the wage gap is explained by the percentage of women who 
were not in the labor force during previous years, the age of women, and the number of children in the home. 
 >Women, especially working mothers, tend to value “family friendly” workplace policies 
more than men. Some of the wage gap is explained by industry and occupation, particularly, 
the percentage of women who work in the industry and occupation. 
 Is 4.8 and 7.1 percent. The study concludes that and I cite: 
 >The report demonstrates that it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women. 
 Partially supports OP's position  It says that there is wage gap, but argues that it cannot be determined whether it is because of discrimination or not. 
 > 
 Says that wage gap below $100,000 is 4-5%, but with wages higher than $100,000 is quite vast.  Doesn't SUPPORT OP's position! 
 > 
 Shitty source material. Doesn't provide where the fuck they got those numbers from. For example they say this, without any source: 
 >Women business owners make less than half of what male business owners make, which, since they have no boss, means it’s independent of discrimination. 
 DOESN'T SUPPORT OP's POSITION, BAD SOURCE! 
 > 
 Study about how testosterone affects risk aversion and aggression in man and woman. Interesting study. Studies results suggest that testosterone has both organizational and activational effects on risk-sensitive financial decisions and long-term career choices. 
 Doesn't support OP's position  because the wage gap percentage has been adjusted for the effects career choices may play and as the first source OP cites says that it is from 4.8 and 7.1 percent. 
 > 
 Wrong sources OP, it shows that there is a gender discrimination. 
 >However, there were sex differences in the reasons given for unequal career advancement, personal career progress, achievement of the last promotion received, and why a future promotion may not occur. Additionally, although male and female managers have similar aspirations to obtain a senior management position, women are less likely to expect a promotion. The results partially support the predictions of social-role theory.

"I posted this on /r/tifu and I was told you guys may get a kick out of my story. It happened yesterday evening. 
 I have made many dumb fuck ups in my life but this one takes the cake. It happened about an hour and a half ago. Before i begin I want to note that I work at a popular large supermarket chain that usually is a nice place to work and I have an issue with epilepsy where instead of getting all shaky, my mind loses consciousness like a giant space out. It causes me to get blurry vision, blurry thinking and makes me look all around dumb unfortunantly and makes me feel aggravated, it happens mainly when I am overwhelmed and over stressed. To make matters worse my meds stopped working so this has been real bad the past few days.
But now to the story. So I was checking out a group of people when two of them (in their young twenties) were buying beer. I said I was unable to sell it because it is my stores policy (maybe a law) that when a group is sold alcohol all members must prove they are over 21. They were pissed. The oldest guy was bitching me out, all of them at once trying to get me to sell it and I said if the two girls got their ID's than I would do it for them. They just kept on bitching and bitching and getting in my face until I snapped. I lost it. My seizures were horriable, I had one after an other, not being able to think or hear or see right. After 15 minutes of this and not being allowed to leave my register and suddenly my manager no where to be found I yelled at the guy.
""I explained this to you before! I can't sell it! Get it? Can you understand what I'm saying or are you too stupid?""
""Fine the girls will get their ID's"" he bitched. And he refused to move. ""But what if it was my kid? Huh? What would you do then?"" He said while the girls walked as slow as Possiable glaring at me. Finally they got back and showed them to me and threw them at me. That was it!! I was so done!!
""Fuck you! I'm sick of this! You have been bitching at me for the last 20 minutes and it's not my fault! I'm just trying to keep my shitty fucking job. And if you can't figure out why it would be different if it was your kid you are a dumb ass. Use your head for gods sake!! Thanks for the ID."" And I threw it at them. Lightly though if that makes a difference. He had his jaw dropped.
""I want to speak to your manager!"" He screamed.
""Sure!"" I said so sarcastically. ""Let me get her for you! We will all talk together and discuss why I was so unjustly rude and mean to you."" They paused as I started to walk away. He stopped me.
""I don't want to waste my time. I'm just not going to come through your line!""
I laughed.
""Thank god!! I was worried I would have to see you.""
He glared.
""Horriable customer service!"" He grunted.
""I don't give a shit!"" I said and smiled back.

"Hello TFR! 
 I haven't posted in a while, so I'll give you a little background.. I apologize for the lengthy rant in advance. 
 I work at a small clothing store in a strip mall. We sell trendy junior, misses, and plus clothing. I'm only 17, but have been recognized repeatedly by district and regional managers for my customer service, sales, credit card applications, and ideas. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that despite my age, I am a great employee, I work hard, and get shit done. 
 A few months ago, we got our stores hours cut. I knew I'd be getting less hours, so I didn't get too worked up. I probably went from having ~25 a week to around 15-18. Not too bad. I still had enough to make my car payments, so I was happy. 
 Now to the part about my manager... 
 After making a killing in sales/ credit applications for the day, (all while she sat in the back and yelled at her boyfriend) she started telling me she's going to train me for lead sales associate, and then assistant manager. I was super excited and figured that she'd start the process soon. I was wrong. 
 Two days later while I was working, a girl, let's call her sarah, comes in and asks for my manager, (who will remain nameless since I can't think of a nice name to call her) who had been camping out in the back room of the store for the past two hours, playing on her iPhone. I called back to her, and the conversation went a little like this... 
 Me: <manager>, Sarah is here to talk to you about something! 
 Manager: (screaming from the back room)  WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT SCREAMINGGUMMYBEAR?! 
 Me: Sarah is here to see you. 
 Manager: (in super sweet voice) Oh! Send her back! 
 I was shocked. But Not surprised. She uses language like that towards me constantly, usually without any regards to customers or children. 
 I was then yelled at later that day for ""interrupting my important fucking phone call"" and was told ""if <DM> (who's never met me personally) didn't like you So damn much i would have fired you months ago. You can't do your job. Or any other job. You're stupid. You can't do anything right. You're a horrible associate."" and tons of comments just like that. For an hour straight. 
 I was then told that Sarah was starting the next day. And that my 18 hours for that week will be cut down to 5 so that Sarah could work 11hours. The only days I was scheduled was Friday and Saturday night. For 2.5 hours. Bullshit. 
 This set me off beyond words. The manager targeted me, and took MY hours. No one else's.  And since then, I've been getting between 5 and 10 hours a week. Usually only for a few days. And Sarah gets double of mine, as well as being called in for multiple extra shifts. 
 I feel like I've been targeted by my manager. I feel like there's nothing I can do to fix it. She only likes me when I make her look good. I've tried looking for another job, and I was hired at another store, but was told that I was too young to work. I'm really not sure what to do. But financially I can't leave.

"I had the most wonderful Tuexedo cat names Wadsworth and he was killed by an evil little fucker like the one doing this.  We lived in this small community of townhomes in the middle of a huge city and there were tons of strays living around and under the buildings.  They kept having babies over and over and it was just really out of control.  After a long discussion with my mother-in-law we decided to do something about it so every week I would catch one and take it to the vet and she would pay to have it spayed or neutered and then when it was all better I would return it to the complex.  I also fed all of them and genrally tried to give them love and attention and if any of them were sick then I would take it to the vet and nurse it back to health before returning it to it's ""family"" (all these cats along very well together). 
 Since I spent so much time with them I got to know all of them really well and began to notice that cats I had been used to seeing began to disappear.  I didn't think too much of it at first since they were strays and that isn't an easy life and thought perhaps they had run away or been taken in or something.  Most of the kids in the neighborhood knew who I was and I guess thought of me as ""the cat lady"" or something either way I guess they felt more comfortable coming to me about some troubling shit.  I get a knock on my door one day and there are about 6 or 7 kids standing there all looking upset.  They begin to tell me about this horrible fucking kid who has been terrorizing the cats and that day had been tossing a kitten up in the air before finally stomping on it's face.  Needless to say I was furious!  All these kids were terrified because it wasn't just the cats being terrorized by this evil little fucker.  I got them to show me his townhome and then they all fled to hide.  I knock on the door and neither parent speaks english and the translater is that evil little fuck who at least looked kind of scared but it was obvious the message wasn't getting to mom and dad in any meaningful way. 
 I then go on a hunt for my cats who with the exception of Wadsworth pretty much stay inside.  Wadsworth got along really well with the other cats--especially the kittens--he really loved kittens.  I had let him out of the house that morning and wouldn't you just fucking know it when I couldn't find him.  Three days later with the help of the kids I found him all fucked up...it was one of the most horrible things I'd ever seen. 
 Called the cops...nothing.  Called my landlady...she at least sent them a letter saying if anything else happened they would be kicked out.

"I'm a Truck Driver, I operate a rig and service a contract for my fathers business. I live in a different city than my parents but both of our cities are on my freight run. This allows me to keep the truck @ my house during off hours with the exceptions of maintenance and repairs. 
 I work graveyards (dam next day service) so I usually roll out of bed at 5pm around the time my wife and 5 year old daughter get home from their days. 
 On to my fuck up... I roll out of bed at the usual and proceed about my business getting supper on the stove. My wife and daughter get home and we visit over supper. After supper my daughter wants to play in the yard as my wife and I clean up and visit before I roll out for work. 
 My regular truck was in for maintenance and the spare was dreadful the previous night so I grab my iPhone and ring up my pops and ask him if my truck is done and ready. It is, I'm elated I get my rig back (it's been my baby for 7 years). I say goodbye and end the call, holding the phone screen up towards my palm like I'm holding a deck of cards and put it on the counter. I'm so excited to be back in my truck I slink 2 steps over behind my wife and launch in to my impression of a ""Cousin Kissing Hillbillly"". 
 Couple well placed gropes and my wife says settle down to which I crap out something to the effect of: 
 ""you were given 1 more brain cell than a cow so you have the capacity to do the dishes without shitting on the floor, but not enough intelligence to carry on s conversation or tell me what to do while you scrub them dishes"" 
 She is smirking and I'm egged on so I proceed... 
 ""God dam you woman, you'll speak only when you are spoken too and I'm speaking at you not to you so shut your cock holster"" 
 and on and on I go.... 
 My wife is giggling I'm almost crying from laughter it was fun but the moment has passed so I reach for my iPhone and My heart drops. 
 Why is my screen lighting up as I grab my phone?  In bold letters I see ""DAD"" and the timer is running well over 2 minutes. Apparently my fat Palm hit the screen and called him back. I am mortified it all flashes before me. What the fuck all did I just say? I feel like a knob he wasn't here he didn't see/hear the context and that we were playing around. Without a second thought I hit end call and make this worse. 
 I head off to work and sheepishly call my dad from the truck. Ask him did you hear that? He replies yes. I explain it was a joke, and I'm sorry if I said anything that offended you. He DOESNT believe me and thinks he has raised an abusive prick who is getting off verbally abusing his wife. I explain again and ask him to call Allison if it makes him feel better. End the call and my phone rings 15 minutes later. It's my Mom and she is pissing herself laughing. She gets it and finds it absolutely comical that my father has taken this as real and won't listen to anyone.

"GIANT wall of text. sorry but i cant stop thinking about it now that ive read this. I worked as a cashier at a small grocery store. This man came into the store all the time. At first he only came into my line occasionally. He was nice and smiled most days. Its nice to have a friendly customer, so I joked and made nice small talk with him whenever. This wasn't unusual. I live in a small town and there a lot of constant customers that know me and we all talk and keep up with each other.
 Well it came to a point that this man would always come to my line. no big deal people have there favorites. Then one day he comes in my line and asks me if i have a boyfriend. I laugh it off and say yes (I didn't but I don't look for love at work!) The man just smiles and asks me for my number. when i tell him no as nicely as possible he just says thanks and leaves. 
 A few weeks pass by and I am leaving to go have lunch (sr. year of HS) I had just given my friend my phone number to text me.  I get a text. ""Hey there :) what are your plans tonight?"" I answer telling who i thought was my friend that i had to work but we could hang out this weekend. ""Oh! I thought you had a boyfriend. but im glad your down to hang out. "" ...........   who is this? ""its  __  ! im  always in your line etc.."" im sorry i thought you were someone else please stop texting me. i didnt give you my number this isnt right im 17 .   ""darlin dont be shy""  i never respond. and he doesnt pursue. 
 later that night im at work and its almost closing time.. 11 pm. a woman comes through my line and just stands there looking at me. there arent many customers in the store. its just me and her at one end of the line of registers, the security man and the manager are chatting all the way on the other side. 
 ""do you have anything to say for yourself you fucking slut??"" 
 I'm stunned looking at this woman, i can tell shes drunk. she reeks of booze and she looks like shes been crying. 
""your fucking my husband and texting him and talking about how your going to hang out this weekend behind my back..."" 
she goes on and on getting louder and more mad. not letting me talk or defend my self or explain how her husband some how got my number and was creeping! 
 im waving my hand over at the men across the store but they cant see her as a candy booth is blocking their view. i look back at the girl and she goes to punch me!! i move out of the way and now im waving one arm holding off this crazy woman who thinks im fucking her husband and the security man FINALLY sees me waving but only sees half of me and what does he do? HE JUST WAVES BACK SMILING 
 finally when the crazy bitch SHOVES me against my register he sees what the fuck is goin down and runs over. shes arrested and crying and cussing me out everyones looking at me like what the fuck did you do and im just shocked.

"I found this comment from a while back on this subreddit and I found it pretty interesting. Here it is; 
 ""People are so easy to understand. All we do is consume and destroy and then use every act of charity we do whether it be to humanity or some half ass remedy to alleviate some of what we fucked up as an excuse to suck our own self righteous cocks. We're glorified monkeys whose sense of self worth and perceived superiority to everything else in the universe drive us closer and closer to annihilation through the depletion of everything we touch. Natural disasters show us how feeble we are. We run around like a bunch of frightened idiots. Oh how great we are when hundreds of members from our master race are being slaughtered by the minute by the natural forces we claim to be superior to. It's funny. We think we are the fucking shit and as soon as something interrupts the monotony of our soulless existence we get all nervous and start throwing a shit fit. We bitch and moan about being office drones, but the second we don't get to live out that same routine we're like a chicken without its head. We're like the machines we make except we're obsolete. 
 We talk of god as if a being who has the ability to create the universe actually gives a shit about a bunch of mindless ants too afraid to even acknowledge they're absolutely meaningless. Yay yay I'm special God loves me. You're going to die and rot and be fed upon by bugs and worms and that's going to be the best thing you ever do with your life because at least then you have no choice but to do something for someone other than yourself. So while you're living enjoy your PhD and embellished writings and the sense of value you place on your life by telling yourself ""Oh I'm an intelligent and accomplished individual"" well great, you're slightly less of an idiot than the rest of us. This only masks the fact that you're but a ball of puss, blood and feces because when you're dead and rotting the reality that you aren't a damn thing but a disposable, insignificant object becomes very clear. 
 Like here I am, going to college. Why? Because I need a degree so I can get a house, which to be able to afford I need a job, and then I'm going buy things so I can keep telling myself ""yea I'm happy, I'm living the life"" but at the end of the day all I'm contributing to is my own bondage. Then when I'm old and can barely take a piss without pulling a muscle I get to retire. I served my time to the system, so I get to ""enjoy"" life as an elderly bitter bastard living in and out of hospitals as my health fails. I'll look back and wonder where all the time went and I'll be too old to do a goddamned thing I wanted to do and I'll die and tell my kids to live a good life and they'll just repeat everything I did and die miserable, but under the guise of ""living a good life"" because it's all too painful for anybody to acknowledge that everything they did in life to make themselves happy was to put just a drop of happiness into an ocean of misery and bullshit that we face from knowing deep down that everything is a big lie to keep feeding the machine.",3129,"Live your life how you want to live because you'll die empty anyway faced with the reality of your own meaninglessness.

"Nope. Alright. I have recently found a fuck buddy. And I'm pumped about it. I've had a 7 month dry spell due to lack of a boyfriend. When I finally decided I wanted the sex without the hassles of a relationship I found a dude pretty easily. I went to a co-worker's house to smoke some trees and the guy was there; we'll call him Tom. So Tom asks my buddy from work, we'll call him Phil if he'll give Tom my number. Work buddy asks me if it's alright. I say sure, Tom isn't the best to look at but he's fucking hilarious and, dude's got big feet. We talk for a couple weeks then hung out at my buddies apartment. Sparks flew, but it was the first night we hung out and things were still unclear, so nothing happened. Fast forward a week, back at Phil's house, this time there's alcohol, the second time I had ever drank, with other people so it wasn't like it was just the 3 of us. I found out I was a super light weight after I got trashed from 3 beers. So we start going at it because we had everything cleared up and both just really wanted laid. Well turns out Phil had other plans and cock blocked uber hard. Total dickbag. Fast forward another week, same set of people are at Phil's, and I'm on my mother fucking period. Strike out number two. A couple days ago, when I knew my house was supposed to be empty, we went there. We get in the door and I hear talking. So I motion for him to go down stairs and I see that my sister's home from school, so we leave. The next day we were going to do the deed at Phil's apartment to get back at him while he's at work. Nope, one of his friends show up. STRIKE. FUCKING. FOUR. Today, after I got off, he said I should come to his apartment because his mom and sister wouldn't be home until the evening. I get to his house at 3, no one is supposed to be home until 4, plenty of time right? WRONG. 3:30 his sister shows up home early from work ( he lives with his mom because he had a falling out with his old roommate ). As we are both fucking pantless on the couch about to get it on. So I fucking barrel rolled off the couch and grabbed my pants and he shoved me in the direction of the bathroom. But I'd never been there before and everything was dark so I just stood there without pants on looking like a deer in head lights. Until he oh so kindly directed me to the correct door. So I put my pants on and sat on the floor taking in what had just happened. He comes and gets me and apparently his sister had left. I was visibly fucking shaking. NOT EVEN THE WORST PART. Then his mom comes home and just let's him have . She walks in the door and her first words are, ""I need to have a talk with you and your little girlfriend."" Then lectured him about trying to have sex in her apartment. She's super religious,  which is why they don't get along. JUST MY FUCKING LUCK. SHE'S RELIGIOUS AND NOT ONLY WERE WE CAUGHT TRYING TO HAVE PRE-MARITAL SEX, BUT WE'RE NOT DATING. Just fucking great. That's strike out 5ish.

"well, if you insist ... 
 so the little fucker and I were living in a sharehouse in Hobart, Tasmania in about 2002; there were about a half dozen hippies, me and Brasco, the cat. The uncut grass in the backyard was perfect for grasshoppers, so the birds would swoop down from the trees on the edges in a low arc across the top of the grass and end up on the fence on the other side. Brasco had been living there about a week when he discovered he could just lie in the long grass, wait for a bird to go overhead and pluck it from the air. It was pretty awesome to see, actually. After about two weeks of this he was bringing in around eight a day, often completely unharmed, and dumping them on my bed. 
 Anyway, the hippies were having none of the slaughter (despite the fact he was almost exclusively targeting starlings and pigeons [feral and who cares, respectively]) and demanded bells be put on the cat. It took him about a week to catch his next bird, and about ten minutes after that for his next. So more bells were added, everytime after that it took less than a day to be able to catch a bird with a different number of bells on the collar. He had seven on there in the end. 
 Anyway, the slaughter started getting RIDICULOUS; he would have literally killed several hundred birds in just three months. And even tho he was largely killing pest species, I was the one who had to clean it up, and the hippies were really starting to protest (HA!). One saturday morning after he brought me my third bird by seven in the morning i flipped - 
 EXCESSIVE CRUELTY WARNING 
 I wrapped him up in a tshirt, tapped it up with duct tape, threw him against the shower wall and turned the cold water on for about an hour. 
 I hate myself for doing it, but at this point there was talk of having him destroyed, and this MOST DEFINITELY reduced his impact on the neighbourhood bird population. Either way, he eventually forgave me, he never brought another bird into the house and the hippies were satisfied. 
 Then one morning I heard the familiar 'SQUEE!!' of a terrified bird getting yanked outta flight, so I ran out the back to call Brasco to account. When I get out there, he's rolling around on the backstep in the sun - he looks up at me casually, squints a greeting and gets up for a pat. I says, ""huh, sorry puss, thought you had a bird. Come in for some delicious cat food."" Cat follows me into the hallway, I go into our room and get the cat food, only to turn around and find Brasco isn't following me anymore. 
 So I go back outside to see where he's at and notice him trotting businesslike down the path to a certain bush. I call, 'hey,' at which point he dives into the leaves under this bush, grabs the live starling he's secreted (stashed/stuffed) under there, darts behind another bush deeper in the garden, reburies the protesting bird, then saunters back out onto the path and tries to be cute again, rolling around on his back and purring real loud and the like. I says, ""NO DICE, VILLAIN,"" and make for the bird, at which point he figures the jig is up, gets there before I do, then laughs at me as he flees over the fence with it.",3148,"Smart cat pretended not to have a bird when it did, in fact, have a bird.",73,0.7909759879112244,0.0014403659151867,0.0142294941470026,9.398945985594764e-05,0.7617166042327881,0.0001774672418832,0.0026120252441614,9.575170406606048e-05,0.3226310014724731,0.0002429456799291,0.0106254927814006,0.0001502285304013,"Brasco the cat was living in a sharehouse in Hobart, Tasmania in about 2002.

"I was going to make a throwaway but fuck it. This is really long but I need major help. 
 A little backstory: I've been with my boyfriend since January 2013. We just had a baby a couple months ago. We've been living together a little over a year now. I personally thought things were getting better but it's only gotten worse in his eyes. 
 We fight. A lot. Mostly about things that can be avoided. Whether I don't like how much weed or cigarettes he smokes, or he doesn't like how I consistently judge other people. 
 I know therapy would be beneficial. I'm waiting on a call back to set one up for myself. Although, I don't think there's any chance of couples therapy. His mom suggested it when we first started fighting, and I was adamant that we didn't need it. Therapy was ""weird"" and that was completely uncalled for because I really like his mom. 
 I feel like nothing ever makes him happy. The first house we moved into he was upset that he couldn't have a dog and I ""uprooted"" him from his life. If he didn't want to move out of where we were living before, he didn't have to. Now we're in a one bedroom apartment with our newborn and he makes it a point to complain about it only when we fight. 
 In July we were supposed to move in with my family to save money to buy a house. We were both out of work at the time so it seemed beneficial (I had a high risk pregnancy and he was injured). After everything was moved I got in an argument with my family and they ended up saying we couldn't move there, leaving us homeless. We ended up crashing on a friends couch for two weeks until we got our own place. 
 I accuse him of cheating more than I should. He shouldn't be accused at all. I know he wouldn't do it but I don't know why I say it. He once said he didn't know if he could control himself because he thinks I cheat. (When we first started dating I told my ex I loved him to fuck with his emotions since he fucked me over and my current bf went through my phone and found the texts). When we fought once when I was pregnant he told me to just leave and I told him I would ""just step out again"". He took that as I cheated on him, which I see where he gets that, but I have never cheated on him. He now isn't 100% sure our son is his (he is) and wants a paternity test. I told him I'm fine with him getting one because there's no possible way he could be anyone else's since I've been faithful. 
 I feel like there is an irrational double standard. He goes out drinking, I haven't been out without him once since I've known him, or drank without him. He gets mad at me if I go out with my mom (who he doesn't like) or am out all day ""pampering"" myself. I wanted to go out for my friend's birthday recently and when the time came he told me he thinks I'm cheating on him. 
 I do things that annoy him, I'm not completely sure what all the time but it seems like just me talking is enough. He keeps things bottled up until he explodes. I wish there was a way to communicate better. I poke and prod and he shuts off. We need a median.

"Need help/advice etc. 
 Today, I walked my dog in the AM and PM, both times aggressive dogs escaped their enclosures and the latter ended up in a 5 second attack on my dog but ended as I tried to be the calm-assertive Cesar Milan and ignore it and walk on. And eventually the attacking dog stopped and just stood in the street as I and my dog continued to walk (but still scared the shit out of me cause I don't know what I can do to end it before its begun or while it happens and not get attacked myself). 
 So the two incidents. 
 AM- aggressive but similar size dog to the beagle I am walking (room-mate's dog). bursts from a hole in the side of the fence and charges. I am thinking (FUCK!!!!) but try to be calm-assertive and continue walking ignore dog. There is some non-violent (no bite) interaction between the dogs (beagle goes submissive onto back) and the aggressive dogs quickly falls into a trot behind me like I'm the pack leader and becomes bored and goes onto other things. On the return pass I pick the other side of the street, the aggressive dog charges across and almost gets hit by a truck, but this incident is more ignorable than the first. 
 PM-
I walked my dog next to what I call the ""meth house."" Almost past and the owner who is back on the side of the house looks like red-heck meth woman doing some garden work. Her dog (Siberian Husky) notices my dog and charges, jumps and clears the pussy 4 foot tall metal fence that says ""beware dog"" and attacks my dog (violently imo) for at least 5 seconds with the beagle is submissive-OMFG-yelp-like-dying mode and eventually, for fucksake the Husky stops as I ""attempt"" to be calm assertive and the husky looks dumbfounded as it stands infront of his fence. Both attacks I tried to ignore aggressive dog and continue walking while my room-mate's dog fucking gets smothered. 
 So I have reported this to public safety for the small town I live in and obviously will not walk this dog on the same street or near these houses again. But Fuck me how can I stop it from happening when walking by a new home with aggressive dogs. I'm really worried about the plural here, two dogs on my dog. Should I carry a weapon on me, a knife, a bat, etc and beat the living shit out of the next assailant that turns violent or worse-red zone (red zone is what Cesar Milan says is a dog that is intent to kill it's target and will ignore anything to achieve that goal)? 
 PS- my room mate is a sack of shit who works 16 days a month and is not here. I'm trying my best to make sure this dog lives a happy life with lots of exercise, discipline, and affection (ala Cesar Milan style). I am walking the dog on lead either at my side and behind me, she is a beagle and calm during these walks (not barking, ignoring most things except interesting smells, which I try to correct here and follow my lead). 
 Important PS- this female Beagle is  NOT SPAYED  and is 6-7 months old and my room-mate got her from his mother who breeds them. Thus this one is not spayed so she can be used for breeding. I am also wondering if this could be a factor affecting aggressive dogs.

"NOTICE: Before you post ""omg ur fukkin dum retard mw2 suks cuz it haz noobtubes blah blah im a faggot blah"" I recognize that, but honestly, only scrubs have problems with noobtubes. Wanna know how to kill someone using them? Go UMP silenced, marathon, cold blooded, and ninja. Poor fuckers will die by the time they see you. OH but wait? UMP is OP you say? Spas. Oh but the spas is OP? How about you camp in an open area so they die before they get close enough to kill you. Oh but camping is OP? Use noobtubes to kill campers. The cycle goes on forever. That is what makes the game fun. 
 I have been playing MW2 a lot lately and I am having a blast. Here is a list on why I think it is the best CoD game. 
 
 The maps are fairly big yet are designed in a way that makes them fast paced. I loved pretty much every map. 
 You can do well with any playstyle and every playstyle is equally effective. Want to camp your ass off? Just grab scavenger and some claymores. Want to quickscope? Just  use the intervention and SoH. Want to rush? Make sure to take marathon. Shotguns and SMGs are very fun and effective at rushing. You can also dual wield SMGs and pistols for even more fun. Want to be an annoying prick? Use OMA with tubes, rpg, and danger close. Each has it's pros and cons and you can do good however you want to play. Each can be countered easily if you know how to. 
 Many different, unique, and fun to use guns. I feel that MW2 has the most gun diversity. Pretty much every gun plays differently (although the M4A1 and ACR are pretty similar) and nearly all of them are effective, though there are ones that are clearly better than others (Scar and Famas were top 2). It was just fun to run around with akimbo g18s, or the spas, or dual p90s. 
 The killstreaks are fun, effective, and satisfying to use. Newer CoD games have butchered Killstreaks IMO. It is just so fun to get a predator missle, then a harrier from that, then a chopper or ac130 from that! It just felt satisfying (shout out to /r/oddlysatisfying) to hit people with a chopper or get a triple kill with an ac130. Getting a nuke was always really fun too, especially hearing other people's reactions. Getting a MOAB or KEM strike isn't the same and they are just ""meh."" I could talk more about how killstreaks in other CoD games suck but I think you get the point. 
 The graphics and sounds. Honestly, games like BO and BO2 graphics are just really ""meh"" and I feel that BO was too dull, but BO2 they tried to make it to cheery and colorful. MW2 did have a dull theme but the color pallete was amazing IMO. If you look at MW2's terminal and MW3's terminal there is a huge difference and MW2's terminal looks 100x better IMO. I also loved the sounds of the game. In games like BO and BO2 the guns sound fake or like paintball guns. I think that MW2 hit the nail on the head, especially with the chopper gunner, scar, famas, spas, noobtube, and just so much more. 
 Quickscoping was actually fun. The intervention is the coolest looking gun out of any CoD game IMO and it was just fun to use. I loved how fast you could scope in and playing other Cods and trying to quickscope just feels clunky and slow.",3180,"Every aspect of the game was fun and perfectly done IMO. Yes, there was lots of BS, but you could counter it if you knew what you were doing.

"Dudeeee, first a of all let me tell you that if you want to change anything within yourself YOU HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF THE ATTITUDE, open yourself to new things, even though the seem stupid or whatever. Inform yourself, don't be judgemental. 
 Now, I took psychedelics for one year, mostly LSD, and they gave me the opportunity to save my life. They showed me a whole new world, from how to listen to my body to how to be simply happy. But only showed. Then I had to understand what was being shown to me, so I could work with myself and save my self. But psychedelics were just a tool. 
 You call /r/Psychonaut community a bunch of druggies, something really really far from being a little bit near the truth of what we do here. Drugs, as I've said, are just a tool, and we know so, but we also had to learn that; if it happens that a user doesn't realize that or decides to ""forget it"" or dismiss it. Man, let me tell you that shit just gets fucking wierd, because by the time this happens, you are supposed to have already gained a bit or a lot of undestanding of reality, depending on how you work with yourself. 
 ""What do you mean by wierd?"" you might ask, well in the beggining it is just wierd because, apparently, you feel alright when high on whatever you prefer, but there is this sensation buried deep inside you, and it could hardly be described as anything because of how faint it is, and this sensation if you're smart and conscious enough can save you a lot of trouble, because it means that you should just stop consuming whatever you're consuming and focus on developing yourself instead of wasting this chance of becoming better. In my case, I wasn't, so I was in for a treat, obviously this was a process but in the end it can be said as: I was going freaking insane. So yes, as everything else, in excess drugs WILL fuck you up good and forever, there is no way around that. 
 Moving on with ""the meditators"" issue, if meditating was just sitting around and doing nothing, 90% of reddit would be enlightened by now and I wouldn't have the need to write this, but since it's not the case; meditating is quieting your mind and getting in touch with the universe through your conscience, it is the next step after discovering, ordering and undestanding what you've learned with psycehdelics, because psychedelics will only get you to certain point. 
 As for proof, do you know what a shaolin monk is?? It is the same stuff, but they have lived it since they were born and we're just beggining to undestand it. If that doesn't satisfy you, watch the scarlett johanson's new movie, of course it will seem pure fantasy but you can really teach your body to do that kind of stuff, REALLY. 
 All of this is mostly personal work, but if you want to try it, you should really asociate with people that you trust and that care for you, because you will need all the help you can get. If you decide to explore yourself, this experience will ceirtantly change you completly, it will knock your socks off; with psychedelics it will be quick and bumpy (they aren't really necesary), with meditation it will be slow, gentle and healthier (it is necesary). 
 One free advice: always have happy thoughts wheter you're high or not , it will save you a lot of trouble",3268,"Read what I wrote for you. Open yourself to new things, nobody likes a smartass.

"Throwaway and I'm stoned as fuck in a repair shop lobby waiting for my car, so I may ramble, sorry. 
 In my experience, I don't think it is possible for me. It's why I don't like it anymore, but my first time is probably unobtainable. 
 My 'first' time may be a little outside the realm of typical, I'd abused the fuck out of adderall,vyvanse, coke, and maybe done a line/smoked a puff of ice at a party while drunk a few times...I consider my first time when I sat down with an addict ex girlfriend with 2 grams and stayed up for 3 days as she showed me the 'ways'. Oral doses to start, snorting baby lines, then smoking shards as fast as possible and blowing hotrails while drinking the cherry flavored bong water after every bong rip. We listened to music, fucked in the shower, talked about our lives, cleaned everything all over 10 times...around day 3 I started getting really spun out. On the third day I hit a hot rail that was the biggest of the binge, the amount of smoke that came out of my mouth was unmatched by anything I've seen outside of amphetamine smokers. My heart began to pound, I began sweating instantly, and started getting LSD-esque swirling of patterns and color shifting in my entire vision. She started freaking out a bit, but after I was able to calm down in a few minutes, I was in HEAVEN. I have never been so high/on it/spun out in my life. We fucked and it was better than sex on acid, MDMA, anything. Like, primal shit. I felt like I was wrapped in a skin tight suit of electricity and pleasure, the energy flowed in and out of my body simultaneously every half second, and the tingles...oh, the tingles.  I seriously made a subconscious decision that night to start using meth regularly. 
 Back to the original question, I've used it probably...30? 40? times since (about the last 2 years) and it's never been anywhere near as magical. I've used it for a week straight, I've taken 6 months off, doesn't matter. When it do it with other users, I get paranoid about to cops/sketchy people. When I do it alone, I watch porn and surf reddit for 24 hours straight. I've even used it with my ex that introduced me to it, but her use has ruined her life at this point and she isn't fun/safe to be around. I crash out and feel miserable after. I get paranoid when I'm sweating at work the next day and people ask if I'm alright. I hate lying to those I love about where I've been for days...etc. etc. etc. 
 It's been a few months since I last used, and I doubt I'll ever go back to it. I've never had addiction or habit problems with uppers, though (it's always those damn downers!). It has made life a bit more 'boring'...but I've always seen it as a good thing. Meth made me realize in a weird, roundabout kind of way, that there's nothing wrong with being tired as fuck after a long day at work and smoking a few bowls with a cold drink as you fall asleep. Shedding meth allowed me to easily kick some other harder, nagging habits I had (specifically RC abuse). 
 Sure, I'm not having no inhibition, wild, drug fueled sex with dime piece club girls looking for a fix anymore...but that's okay. I had to remind myself as to what 'normal' is in regards to my expectations for sex, it's gotten easier/more comfortable.

"Just fucking do it. I finally got into the mindset that I don't want to be friends with these women. I do not relate to them, instead, I find them fascinating. 
 Armed with these new tools, I text girl one. ""Were going to Monster Disappointment VIP on Saturday, your going!"" and receive a ""Whats that? sounds scary!!""  putting it off for the day, because the whole event is sketchy, I respond with ""The even was canceled, were hitting the town when your off work!"" 
 Leaving no doubt in anybody's mind, she comes over to our house totally devoid of furniture, with 3 guys, a plastic table and a game of beer pong. I have met this girl one time... 
 But it doesn't matter, nothing matters, the only thing that matters is how she feels!  Now when there are two thick accents, three crazy costumes, and everybody is having the time of their lives, even before she shows up! All she is feeling is how lucky she is too bear witness to the spectacle. 
 Loud music, photo shoots, crazy bets, homosexuality, bromance, and a frame of sexuality from everybody in the room, I have never seen a shy Asian girl feel more at home. We reenacted cave man mentality and the only thing left to do was copulation, so I went for it.  everybody was touching everybody, so when i put my hands around her waist, and went strait for a kiss, all I got was passionate compliance, and a question ""Oh my god, how much have you had to drink?!? I've only been here for 10 minutes..."" 
 ""honestly only about 1 beer"" 
 ""Why did you kiss me?"" 
 ""Cause I felt like it"" 
 Then I lead her into one of the empty bedrooms, and we started going it at it on the empty floor! 
 only problem is that she had not had sex in over a year, and she was on her period, two frames that were going to be very difficult to overcome.  So as I sat there, watching this knockout HB-8 actress give me this wild Neanderthal style blowjob, I was pondering.
""Why haven't you had sex in a year?"" 
 She looked up, lips wrapped tightly around me with a look of 'Are you serious, i'm sucking your cock' plastered all over her face. 
 ""No seriously."" 
 ""umm, well I broke up with my boyfriend and I swore to myself that I would never just have random sex, I want it to mean more."" 
 I pulled her close to me, and laid out some wisdom.  Sex is easy, sex is natural, and because of that, it is meaningless like every other thing in the universe.  But when you meet people, and interact with them, you make meaning. Sex is sex, unless you can some how make it an expression of feeling, far rarer, yet more prevalent than any other type of sex. 
 ""What do you mean?"" 
 "" I mean the rare type of interaction that once found, you hold onto, in one way or another... And this is not it, So lets get out of here."" 
 I stuff my blue balls back into my booty shorts, and we hit the town with my two accented buddies! taking pictures with everybody getting in free wherever we went! Rowdy and fun. Rowdy and fun. Guys pay to go to clubs because of women, women go to clubs for guys who are rowdy and fun!  blasting music on the drive back, we opened the front door, I lead her to the empty room, and we made passionate love, a type of sex that was a continuation of the evening, and an expression of the fun she was having.

"We've all fucked up at one point... but this past weekend, it was a royal fuck up and I could have avoided it by simply asking her last name. 
 I'll start from the beginning. My wife and I have been married for 5 years, and we are in an open relationship. We swing with other couples and we each have a boyfriend/girlfriend on the side. We also date freely if we so choose. One night stands or overnights are not uncommon. 
 Here goes... deep breath. It's Friday afternoon and I'm browsing OkCupid. My wife is going on and on about holiday plans, people coming into town, etc. etc... I'm kind of done with it already. Been there - done that - leave me alone and let me chill in peace. Had I listened, this all may have been avoided (TIFU #1 - Didn't listen to my wife.) 
 This girl pops up, and I've never seen her before. Her profile mentions she will be in my area for a few days and is looking for casual sex. Now this woman seems oddly familiar for some reason, but being a guy, I just assume the best and carry on. Very attractive woman. Easy 9 for any guy. This is exactly what I need to vent some of my holiday frustrations. So I shoot her a message asking her why she's in town.. what she's looking for.. etc. 
 She replies back within minutes. I sneak outside for a smoke and text her back. After chatting for about 30 minutes, she gives me her number and says to send her a text the next day. 
 I wake up on Saturday and shoot her a text, letting her know who I was and that I was still interested. We exchanged a few messages, names and location/time details. (TIFU #2 - Didn't get her last name) We set up a time and place, get together and exchange casual conversation in a local coffee shop at about 8pm. Needless to say, we hit it off. She reminded me a lot of my wife... bubbly, fun, and sexy as hell. 
 My wife is home, so I can't take her back to my place, so I do the next best thing. Hotel. 
 We head over to the hotel and hook up. The sex was over the top. Absolutely amazing. I was a bit sad she wouldn't be in town for more than a few days, but I've gotten used to not getting attached over women being a swinger and all. 
 So I head home and she leaves, going back to her parents house she says. 
 I tell my wife my date was good (we don't exchange details) and I wouldn't be seeing the woman again. All is well and good. I had my fun, and now it's off to the family's house for their early Christmas dinner before my wife and I leave town. 
 Ok - this is where shit hits the fan. 
 Girl I just slept with opens the door. Her face was paralyzed as her eyes go from my wife to me, then back to my wife. I was just as stunned as I stood there, unable to move. 
 My wife introduces me to her sister, then walks in the door being all bubbly and fun talking with everyone. 
 I'm standing there staring at the woman. She finally turns away from me and walks into the house then into the back room. She never came out. Claimed she was ""sick."" 
 The night continued then my wife and I went home. 
 ~~
So there it ends. I haven't told my wife yet, and obviously the sister hasn't said anything yet either. 
 NOTE: I never met her sister and I've never seen any pictures. I don't get together with her family often. 
 TIFU - Big time. No clue what to do. At my parents house out of town now and sitting in the basement at 4:30 am on Reddit.

"TRIGGER WARNING FOR RAPE AND CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT, INCEST, ABUSE, SELF HARM, AND EATING DISORDERS] 
 sorry i dont have it in me to capitalize or anything right now 
 so, yikes, where the fuck do i start?
i'm pretty sure ive been depressed since i was about 6? before any of my trauma shit and abuse happened. the first time i tried to kill myself was in grade 4, where i tried to hang myself with a scarf off of the monkey bars at school. i got bullied a shitload, had the shit beaten out of me daily when i got outed by my ""friend"", blah blah blah. whatever. 
 my dad and my mom have always been separated. by grade 5 (??? i have trouble comprehending and accurately remembering timelines sorry) my dad gets a new girlfriend. she has two kids, both girls. one was a teenager, which at the time being a shitty little middle schooler, i thought i could look up to her and learn how to be a ""cool teenager"" with her. turns out that dads gf would turn my dad into a huge asshole and encourage him to treat me like the shit under both of their shoes. oh yeah, and that my new step sister would sexually abuse me, beat me, and make threats on my life for about a year. great, right? 
 from then on i'd go through a cycle of being suicidal, mutilating myself in any way i could, starving myself half to death, and being generally self destructive. i'm covered in scars from cutting, burning, and obsessively picking at my skin. my anorexia is in remission, but i almost died from heart failure from getting so small and now i have a shit heart because of it. probably because i smoke too, but whatever. im long out of my dads house now, and he apologized for taking on his girlfriends abusive behavior towards me, but i know that getting out of there is just the beginning of this shitstorm. i constantly have flashbacks, bouts of paranoia and disassociation, hallucinations, chunks of time missing from my memory, and the occasional delusion. cool. 
 i thought i knew the extent of my trauma, but i learned recently that hooooo fuckin boy was i wrong. 
 about a week after i broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years (who was emotionally abusive and beat me at one point lol), i started feeling like something was coming back to me. slowly, memories started to trickle into my subconscious. suddenly i had these disgusting memories. where basically my stepsister not only raped me but she also ""sold"" me tto her friends, they would give her money so that they could rape me too. they also took pictures of me naked and told me that i would be a model and they would ccall me ""X"" (i dont want to put the nickname here i dont want people findinfg it). at first, i thought it was a delusion and my brain was just fucking with me? but i was too scared and i was too convinced so a couple days ago i looked for the alias the men gave me on some gross pedo forums and someone linked me to a picture and its me it s me there  are fucking pictures of 10 year old me and old men are jerking off to them and ive been trying to block iit out but i cant and i am losing myself im losing myself and i want to die so badly ii want to fucking kill myself i feel so dirty i feel fuckign disgusting why am i only remembering this shit now what the fuck is wrong with me why didnt she kill me all those times she threatened to i wish she fucking killed me im about to lose my fucking ashit and i dont know what to do",3393,"just remembered repressed memories of my sister raping me and letting her friends rape me for money, and the fact that there are cp pictures of me that have been circulated and im seriously about to fucking kill myself",218,0.9377912878990172,0.9898199439048768,0.0515384227037429,0.1729220002889633,0.8773931860923767,0.9549498558044434,0.0355847887694835,0.1222107261419296,0.2336754351854324,0.2478820979595184,0.01313585229218,0.0070965900085866,"i'm pretty sure ive been depressed since i was about 6? before any of my trauma shit and abuse happened. by grade 5 (??? i have trouble comprehending and accurately remembering timelines sorry) my dad gets a new girlfriend. she has two kids, both girls. one was a teenager, which at the time being a shitty little middle schooler, i thought i could look up to her and learn how to be a ""cool teenager"" with her. turns out that dads gf would turn my dad into a huge asshole and encourage him to treat me like the shit under both of their shoes. oh yeah, and that my new step sister would sexually abuse me, beat me, and make threats on my life.",643,"mike downey says he's been depressed since he was about 6 . his dad and mom have always been separated .

"Pretty boring month. I got drama from ex-gf who put me down and my friend with who I used to go out was pretty busy. 
 But. 
 There is always a but. 
 The party 
 When I feel sad, I call friends and set a party. No real hot girl most 6s and one I couldn't really say if she was cute or not, but she had great smile as well as nice big boobs (HBchineseBoobs). I was in mood for party and didn't give a fuck about anything. I talked with everyone, dhv and HBchineseBoobs chased me hard asking for fb, contact and shit. Didn't give anything and I teased her instead. She is a close friend of a friend so if I wanted her contact, I still could ask.
Two days after the party, she sent me messages and tried to tease me in order to get some attention from me. I replied to every other message and we set a meeting for hastumoude at a temple next to my place. We went to pray, we ate and I bounced her to my place without difficulty for a movie. We cuddled and she found out my condoms. She asked me about it and since when I didn't have sex. I told her everything and she acted furious, she asked me to not contact her again and she left. I laughed so hard. She sent me 2 messages since like nothing happened. I got a second rule: don't put dick in crazy. 
 Budo 
 I practice since ages budo. In Japan, I'm in some club at some unversity. I asked my sensei where I can train during holidays and he told me about another club and by chance, in the evening there was some nomikai with it and he will be glad to bring me. Never say no to nomikai/party: you can meet new people and practice japanese. Fuck! 1/3 of the members of the other club are female and cute ones ! After training, we went to nomikai. As I was the only foreigner, I could sense the japanese around wanted to talk with me but too afraid to do it. I started talking and #-close some girls. Sadly, they all came back for holidays in the family and I have to wait a bit to meet them again. 
 Countdown night 
 I find countdown night usually boring. Moreover I was pretty tired since I went out with friends the 2 previous nights. In the night of the 31st I went out to buy some drink and food, with the plan to get some rest and leave the fun to other people. By chance I met a friend who grabbed me to his homeparty held by a friend of him. Turned out great. I met this HB8 half japanese half american. My type of girl. I didn't go full straight. I talked to everybody at the party but her. 30 min before midnight, she came straight to me and asked me why I didn't talked to her. I replied that I had to catch up with friends and she did well with all the guys around her. We continued to talk: she is witty, funny and gorgeous. She gave me huge IOIs. For the countdown, we went on the rooftop and we counted down. At 0, I went to her, looking at her lips and kissed her and then pushed her back. Everyone was hugging and I went to hug my friends. We went back to my friends friend place and drank a bit more and danced. HBhafu still gave me IOIs and seemed to get jealous when I talked with other girls. At 1am I asked HBhafu if she wanted to come with me smoke some cigarette on the rooftop. There we discussed a bit more and asked me why I kissed her and replied I was feeling it. We made out and I went for further, slipping my hand under her panties and made her come. She did the same with me.

"She's 13, spoiled and lazy, and she has terrible hygiene. She doesn't brush her teeth so her breath is godawful, she never puts on deodorant (and she's active, plays sports, constantly sweating, etc.). She refuses to shower, it's a fight EVERY single time. She regularly goes 4 or 5 days without washing her body and hair and would probably go longer if I could stand the smell longer. I just snapped because I sat down on the couch and there was this horrible stench from where she's been sitting. Not only did it stink, it stuck to me! So then  I  had to go shower to get it off! I have to open a window and burn candles to even be able to walk into her room! 
 And when I tell her to bathe, what happens? First she ignores me. She'll act as though I'm not speaking, or she'll say ""Okay I will later"" without bothering to look at me (and of course later never comes). 
 Once I plant myself in front of the TV or say ""No, now"" she starts throwing a fit. She'll demand that I get her a towel and START THE SHOWER FOR HER. Um, no, you're going to be in high school in a month, I'm not your mother, you can damn well start your own fucking shower. She'll tell me she's not getting in until I make her a snack, or say that she'll only get in if we go to the movies afterward. Again, no freaking way. ""Well then, I'M not doing it!"" She says it in this nasty, self-righteous tone too, as if it's MY fault, that I've pushed her to this and now I'm getting what I deserve. If you can't tell she's definitely learned this from her parents - they bargain with her to get her to do things because it's easier than discipline. 
 So then I have to go and take her phone, laptop, and the remotes for her TV and Wii (all courtesy of her parents), and lock them up. Once this starts happening she'll fall back into whining and sulking - ""But I don't WANT toooooo right nowwwww, ughhhh"" (that tone THAT FLIPPIN BRATTY ASS TONE!!) 
 Finally she stomps back there and slams the door and the blessed sound of the shower starts. I don't know how she washes herself but somehow it only takes 5 minutes (I'm guessing she thinks dumping shampoo on her head = now I'm clean)  [Not that you can't take short showers, but when you're covered in a week's worth of sweat and grime there really needs to be some scrubbing!] . 
 Besides the not showering I'd say the biggest problem is that she's too lazy to put on deodorant most days, and she really needs to. There's nothing wrong with being a little stinky, we've all been there, but you gotta take steps to be courteous to the people around you! 
 I've tried being nice, sisterly girl talk, offering suggestions, I've tried being funny and doing some friendly teasing, and I've been mean about it too. I've told her point blank that she smells really bad and it's pissing everyone off, and she WILL be teased in school if she keeps it up. I hate to use shame as a motivator but when she's been wearing the same clothes for 3 days in a row and she's literally just laying on the couch texting for hours and it would take like TEN MINUTES TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION, and then on TOP of that she acts like a spoiled little princess who doesn't have to listen to anyone if she doesn't want to, after all the effort I've put into being tactful - OMG!! It just escalates into shouting all the time. 
 I'm assuming she'll grow out of it but for now, I am DONE.

"Since when is being into rough sex automatically admitted you into a fucking cult? 
 First of all, it's not a cult (though a lot of groups act like it), and secondly rough sex isn't really treated like BDSM by most people I know. 
 The BDSM community is a loose term encompassing everyone who practices BDSM in a group setting, or socially. This takes on many forms: classes where people meet to learn how to tie each other up safely and effectively, or to learn safe and sane ways to do things like whipping and other forms of punishment. There are also parties and events; people will rent out venues or rent spaces and host a literal party, which can range from simple performances by local practitioners to full on fetish wear required for entry (ie, people in leather, latex, people on leashes, men dressed as women, etc). 
 And these groups and people are always constantly networking; DomCon, a gathering of dominatrices meets yearly in LA and Atlanta. There's also FetCon, the Montreal Fetish weekend, and many others. They trade info, shoot the breeze, try new ideas... that  is the BDSM community. And trust me, it is far more widespread and common than you even realize. 
 Now, that's not to say there aren't bad apples. Take my earlier example. Miss 'I just watched 50 Shades' is a freshman in college, and fills her Fetlife profile with a few cryptic nudes, and her fetish lists consists of dozens of entries of 'I like to get fucked roughly, I like getting hair pulled, I like a hand on my throat during sex...sex...sex...sex...etc'. Nowhere is there a mention of restraint, sexual fetishes, or even dom/sub relations. Is that really even kink, or BDSM? Especially since, possibly surprisingly, sex is rarely practiced at BDSM events. They aren't swinger parties filled with gangbangs. Sure, there is some overall sexiness, some touching, teasing, stroking, but it's not like people are lining up to get banged. So how does is this sex-craved freshman usually received? Poorly, as you can imagine. As are 20 year old men calling themselves 'Masters' looking for slaves, as are 20 year old women calling themselves 'Mistresses' looking for financial pay slaves to basically give them free money. 
 That's also not to say parts of the community are shit. I think a large part of it is shit, actually. Where I live, there are many elitist groups. People won't even talk to you if you're not even willing to come out and meet the group, for fear that you are a predator. I chatted casually with a girl on Fetlife for about a week. She went to her first group meeting, and thereafter refused to talk to me 'because I wasn't in the group, and that I was dangerous and suspicious...'. Peole don't get along in groups. I was told not to mention a certain woman's name around another because of bad blood between them. People get ousted because they find out, ironically, that people they let into their group are actually terrible, abusive people. 
 The latest in shit where I live was an altercation between two groups. Group A didn't like Group B hosting parties and 'stealing their members', so they straight up SWATted them one night. Not a 'hey, let's call the cops for a noise complaint' this was was 'hello, 911? I just saw a bunch of people torturing and raping women at this building, and they have drugs and guns.'  Cops raided a party full of people in leather and latex having fun, and Group B was pretty much forced to shut down.",3448,Make a Fetlife (kinky facebook) account and do some browsing.,61,0.9654680490493774,0.0028465576469898,0.0329927764832973,9.25720451050438e-05,0.9130967259407043,0.0002509191690478,0.0019084475934505,0.0001281110016861,0.2666708827018738,0.0002375575713813,0.0080464137718081,0.0001630142505746,"The BDSM community is a loose term encompassing everyone who practices BDSM in a group setting, or socially.

"I have been debating writing a small post about this for a bit now. Other posts have said it, the best way to be more of a boss with women is to go out and actually meet women. Every guru says simply being in a setting and reguarly approaching women will do more for you then any amount of reading/theory ever would. The three A's ""Approach Approach Approach"". 
 But if you are like me, you probably have no friends, you played PC Games most of your life and generally aren't to great looking. You going to a bar alone is like you sticking your cock in camp fire. You try to avoid it at all costs. The one trick I have to say that got me OK with going out alone, was taking salsa/ballroom dancing lessons. I spent a month or so taking lessons at a local univerity and then at a dance studio. I met a lot of cool chicks and a month or so later I picked up the skills to be half way decent at it. 
 These last 4 weeks, many months after lurking and trying to force myself to go out more with no success. I went out to a salsa bar and I was amazed... 
 Story time Bitches. 
 It was friday night at 10 PM and it was starting to get busy. I got to the bar and I gulped down some water, I looked around with aprehension and waited for eye contact like any good sedditor does. I was still nervous and sweaty as a guy masturbating in a church bathroom. ""I dont belong here, What if they find out I am a lonly basterd who is here to touch women?"". I breath heavy, as thoughts of someone calling the cops fill my head. 
 I decided that walking around the place in circles is the best way to sort this out. Standing at the bar was making me feel nervous. Jesus be praised so many hot chicks just sitting and staring into space. I walk around and around and realize no one was giving me eye contact. So I decided to just bite my lip and walk up to the first girl and take the plunge. First one is the hardest right? 
 ""Uh... Dance?"" were the only two words I uttered. 
""OH um no thanks"". 
 Shit balls fuck. 
 That happended 2 more times and I felt like running out the door. I sat down in the corner, thinking of something that could both kill me and get me out of here at the same time. But, instead of diving out the nearest window and into on coming traffic, I thought about what I was doing wrong. I suddenly realized I wasn't smiling, or even using full sentences, and my posture was terrible. I coached myself and the next girl I walked up too gave her great eye contact, a big smile and asked her name before I even asked her to dance. 
 ""Hi! You look cool, whats your name"" 
 "" Im Blah blah""  giggles 
 (O shit she giggled, I am totes in). 
 ""Sweet! Lets dance!"" 
 ""Oh, yeah sure!"" 
 This did wonders and the rest of the night no one said no~ I danced and had fun with over 10 girls in a hour or so. Had even one girl compliment my dancing! I found a couple of girls from class as well and danced with them. It was a fun first time solo night gaming. 
 Since then I have been out about 3 or 4 more times soloing. I meet new girls every night. I just got 2 numbers last time I went, so I am getting better. One of the numbers wants to meet up tonight~~
So if you want a tip to make things a big easier with night game, take some lessons, and you suddenly have reason to be at the bars alone.  Anyone asks why you are alone, give a ""Im just here to learn!"" type of reply. Makes you seem like a cool person whos trying to get out more, less like a creeper.",3449,"Take ballroom dance lessons.

"Lol I hear you man, I didn't want to keep going on and on about it. I find that people generally don't like to read a GIANT WALL OF TEXT, I tried to keep it as bare bones as possible. 
 I'll try to answer all of your questions though, to clear the air a bit. 
 >If the mine is pitch black, what the fuck are they doing in there? 
 
 The government of that world aren't too keen on sparing expense for those level of criminals.  
 
 >Just waiting around to die? 
 
 Think of the Mines like hell itself, you're going to be there a long time and it's going to SUCK. You can kill yourself, but once you're  that  strong, everyone thinks they are better than that. They try to escape or survive until they CAN escape.  
 
 >How do they get fed? 
 
 At what point do you say to yourself, ""I'm hungry, there is no food, there are other people, people are food, I am hungry."" 
 
 >If you can find the entrance and you are freed, then why doesn't everyone just band together to find the entrance and escape? 
 
 The Mines themselves are alive. It's a living part of the world, and while the way in is always the same, the way out is always different. Think of them as the Labyrinth; you aren't finding the entrance unless she wants you too, or are clever enough to trick her.  
 
 >If you escape you become a warden? Why the fuck would a former prisoner want to become a guard? Is it mandatory? 
 
 Not mandatory. Everyone who mangers to escape (which doesn't happen very often to begin with) are given the opportunity at new life either on their homeworld or Terra, the home of the Mines. (You have to remember that these individuals are extremely powerful and valuable assets that any government would love to get their hands on).   
 
 >If not, then I imagine a lot of criminals would want to return to their homes and their old habits. 
 
 Very few have gone back to their old habits after escaping. Most, when offered a job, say no, take a ship, and fly as far away from ANYONE as possible. Being sent to Mines is one of those ""worst that death"" things everyone loves. Not even gonna try to hide from that cliche.   
 
 >If the mines prisoners are deemed to powerful to leave, then why in the fuck are they allowed to walk out if they can find the entrance? 
 
 They are allowed to leave, in the hope that the Mines did their job on them. It's a less humane way of rehabilitating criminals. Why try to fix you the proper way when we can break you and put you back as something brand new?  
 
 >Speaking of the entrance, when the prisoners are brought in, or maybe ported in? 
 
 The singular way IN to the Mines is at the top of a VERY high volcano. Which, as you can expect, prisoners are dropped rather unceremoniously into that abyss.  
 
 If the battle of whatever you were doing to get thrown into the Mines in the first place doesn't kill you, the fall doesn't kill you, the Mines don't kill you, other prisoners don't kill you, other creatures don't kill you AND the wardens don't kill you, you can sure as shit believe you'd be free to go if you can get pass all those obstacles that are just as strong, if not stronger, than you. 
 As per the wardens, there are only two (if we aren't counting the Mines themselves) and these two actually LIKE the Mines. They like the cold, and the darkness and especially the screams of the Mines' victims. They were also the last two to escape in over three hundred years. (The age thing bleeds into a larger portion of the universe I've created. The",3491,"version of that is Terrans, and all from the Gale Nebula [Mirran Star System], live for a  very  long time).

"This isn't a throwaway account because as far as I know no one involved in this story uses Reddit... Or at least I hope. So a little bit of backstory (I'm sorry if my writing is a little ho-hum, but I want to keep it short): 
 I am 21 years old. The girl in the story just turned 18. We used to hook up in high school and we actually went to prom together. Then I found out that she was lying to me a lot about certain things which are beyond the scope of this post - but it was pretty fucked up. So I ended it. Fast forward a few years and we're hooking up again. And it's great. I think I'm falling for this girl. But in the back of my mind I know that it's just because she's ridiculously hot and when we're hooking up it's awesome in that moment. The only problem is, she seems very distant otherwise. She always cancels dates with me, leaves in the middle of hooking up, etc. I then find out that she's been hooking up with another guy on the side... Bitches, I know. So I end it. That's already two. So she ends up dating the other guy. Fast forward 1 year. She's still dating him but apparently she isn't enjoying the relationship. Now at this point I have hardly talked to the girl because in my mind, I'm done with her. Well she had different plans. She gets drunk and texts me naked pictures of herself. She tells me that she's always liked me and that we should have sex. I should mention at this point that up til now, when we hooked up it was just some making out and dry humping, nothing more and no clothing was removed. Now she's sending me naked pics and asking for sex. Well I politely decline and cite all the instances where she's fucked me over. And trust me this girl is a crazy bitch. And I know Reddit's stance on sticking dick in crazy. But keep reading trust me... She says I should give her another chance... The next day she sends me another naked pic and asks for a picture of my dick. I again say no. She says go fuck yourself and that was the end of that. Well just recently I go to a birthday party of hers - her boyfriend is there, her family is there... And she's texting me ""Hey sexy ;)"" and rubbing my leg under the table. Later that night she shoves me into the bathroom with a girlfriend of hers and a bottle of vodka and says ""We're going to take a shot of vodka and chase with a kiss."" So her friend takes a shot and the two of them kiss. Then she takes a shot and pulls me in close and tells me to kiss her. I say no. Then she says for me to take a shot and choose who to kiss. I take a shot and say ""I'll pass"". I know, I know, this shit is fucked up. To make matters more complicated, I'm also best friends with her cousin and he said he would be pretty upset if I hooked up with her. And I'm also kind of hooking up with this other girl from college, but we're nothing official, and she told me that she wants to take it slow and not have sex. I'm also a virgin (surprise, right?) so I'd really regret not taking this opportunity to lose my v-card. Also this bitch is incredibly hot. Definitely above the average of any girl I'd get, so I should take advantage of that right? 
 Ok so this crazy girl is leaving for college in about a month so if I do something it would have to be soon. But that's good right? I could fuck her and say ""Peace, have fun in college!"" The problem is that I know she just wants to fuck me in order to break up with her boyfriend and I don't want some crazy dick boyfriend to be coming after me either.

Obviously this system does NOT work for us, the people who maintain this thing running, the people who makes this assholes gets richer! 
 WE NEED TO  do something and I don't mean sign a petition (after all they don't even care), or go sit in the open waiting for some idiotic uneducated  law officer  to spray the fuck out of us.
I know it's extreme but we need to do some real damage. There is something we could do. 
 WE HAVE TO  tear down this capitalistic crap and make a  REAL GOVERMENT  run by the people and FOR the people. I'm not talking about communism, that doesn't work either; but a more humanist term (Socialism comes to mind, and I know you guys have been scared about this word, i mean wars against it, media against it, every US politic against it; but Socialism isn't gonna get your babies eaten) And like Michael Moore said Capitalism only worked because it was installed in the right time in the right place (WWII; US didn't have real competitors because everything was bombed to the ground for Europe and Japan), but it's based on greed and egoism, it promotes to people to be mean to each other, because that's how you get rich and powerful (and everybody wants that, don't they?) *[Capitalism, a love story]( 
 WE SHOULD  make them pay. There can be a lot of ways to do so and fall, and crush when they fall, and die when they crush when they fall, like  NOT BUYING SHIT  from the people who don't deserve our hard-working-earned money (it can't be that hard to not buy a movie, go to the cinema, or dress with fancy clothes); instead you can buy it used, they don't make a damn dime in the process and you still can help little/medium shops, therefore supporting they workers so nobody lose their jobs; demand excessive police force in international institutions, like ONU, I don't know; Don't believe anything from the media; We have to make some sacrifices in order to win what we want; Look at what happened in Egypt or Tunisia, Our so called  developed countries  can't do that also?; demand, DEMAND,  DEMAND !! 
 And I had it!  With this  motherfucking assholes  in this  motherfucking country ! Why the rest of the world has to deal with your shitty decisions (I'm talking to you conservative republicans and willingless democratics, you are all the same), I know it can be hard to elect nice people (maybe there isn't any)...

"So, Im in a really weird, fucked up situation with my girlfriend, best friend and his girlfriend. 
 About two years ago I moved in with my highschool best friend, my girlfriend and his girlfriend. I knew his girlfriend was annoying beforehand - but I have a high tolerance and good headphones so I figured ignoring if needed would be fine. Im going to call my best friend Jeff, and his girlfriend Sarah for sake of story and not specifically calling anyone out. 
 Now, Sarah is a lazy, gold diggin' bitch. Excuse the language. 
Jeff works 65 hours a week to support Sarah. He pays for her rent, her hydro, her internet, her cellphone, her videogame's, her food, her woman products and whatever else you can think of. Sarah works 12 hours a week and spends every last penny on herself. Sarah also doesnt clean, or do anything to help the rest of us out because she's incredibly self centred. We've lived in this apartment for 2 years and the only room she has cleaned (twice) is her own bedroom. She occasionally does her dishes, and her laundry. Jeff and Sarah constantly fight and argue, while Sarah gets more physical, Jeff gets louder. Hes a level headed guy, and if he crossed any questionable lines I wouldnt defend him, but Ive never seen someone hold their shit together so well. Sarah, also skypes all day with random men on the internet, generally about videogames - because to everyones surprise, these guys are buying her things in these videogames, and she thinks its funny to the point of bragging about it. Jeff also recently told me that him and Sarah have done nothing sexually in over 3 years (what the actual fuck). However, on top of all the bullshit we have to be around due to Sarah, its actually driving a wedge in my relationship with both my girlfriend and my best friend. 
 My girlfriend and I can only clean so often before it starts getting stressful, especially when every room in the apartment is done by us two, whether we dirtied it or not. Bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, livingroom - all on us. Jeff helps when he can, but working 12 hours a day, I dont expect the guy to come home and clean, shower, make dinner for himself and Sarah and still have much time to himself. My girlfriend does not want to live with Sarah anymore, and neither do I - but we both love living with Jeff because he's a solid guy and has his shit together. So, my girlfriend and I cant live here anymore, but I dont want to live without Jeff - because Im not sure Im ready to get a place with my girlfriend alone, especially with us arguing more often lately. 
 Now - Jeff, while a solid friend, is kind of short tempered when it comes to confrontation about things he doesnt see his way. Which leaves me in a weird place. I dont know how to bring up the fact that Sarah is literally making everyone hate living here.  I dont like confrontation, I kind of shut down in a sense and or dont say things I'd like to for sake of argument. I know this is a situation Im just going to have to do this in, and thats fine, but I dont know how to approach it properly. 
 How do I tell my best friend that I want to continue living with him, but not his girlfriend? How do I also tell him that if he continues living with her, then my girlfriend and I are leaving, and how do I tell my girlfriend that if Jeff isnt going to leave his girlfriend, that I cant live with her alone because Im scared of commitment at 22 and we're too unstable?

"This is fucking awesome: 
 I waited tables at this Ameritalian place (think Jonny Corrino's style) and had a manager that was a complete bull. No fucking neck, barely fit into his manager's polo shirt, bald shiny ass fucking head, and a really, really loud deep voice. The kind of manager that stands at the end of the line on a busy night acting like a football coach for the losing team at a Super Bowl. Very intimidating. 
 I was coming in for a shift at about 4  or so I arrive a bit early to get into work mode and give some of my fellow servers some killer pot I had scored. I'm coming back into the restaurant from the back room area where all the odds and ends shit is stored, when I see this guy in the bartender area getting a little loud. He starts getting even louder, yelling something about there not being enough whiskey in his jack and coke. 
 Steve, the hulking always a little pissed off about something was being the calmest I had  ever  seen him in the 4 years on and off that I worked there, telling the gentleman that his bottle top measures an exact shot and that if he wanted more whiskey he would have to pay for a double. This guy just explodes, and starts yelling as loud as he can that he wants his fucking drink or he was going to sue the restaurant. Laughable claim, but very belligerent man 
 At this point, the entire restaurant is looking over at the bartender area when this fucker picks up a HUGE tip jar (made of glass btw) and hurls it at Steve. Steve ducks the tip jar and it ends up smashing into this GIGANTIC fucking mirror that was the backdrop for the bar. (I'm talking 11ft x 15ft or so.) 
 All you heard was the biggest fucking crash of glasses, mirror, tip jar, and bottle of liquor, tinkling to a drop on the alcohol soaked, change covered floor. 
 At this point time almost stopped for me. I remember looking at the guy who threw the jar, then looking at Steve with a horrified expression on my face, wondering what kind of suicidal maniac would do some crazy shit like throw a tip jar at a motherfucker that could be Stone Cold Steve Austin's twin brother. 
 Steve hurdles the bar like an Olympic fucking athlete and closes on this guy. I remember the fellow got off sort of a weak left handed haymaker that never even came  close  to hitting Steve. Steve picks this guy up like he weighs nothing, and throws him down like the final chip at a blackjack table from a broken down gambling addict. The tip jar throwing douchbag goes down like fucking wheat in a chaff. He attempts to throw another punch from under Steve, but gets to meet Steve's vicious left hook first. 
 Steve pummeled this guy like he stole his daughter's virginity and knocked her up. I mean, HOLY SHIT did this guy get the hell beat out of him. A few broken teeth, gash over his left eye, blood is EVERYFUCKINGWHERE. 
 After thoroughly mopping the floor with the guy, he calmly gets up, and tells me to call the police. I'm standing there fucking speechless, Steve is absolutely  covered  in this guy's blood. It's on his hands, his forearms, his pants, his white polo shirt, it's dripping off of his brown penny loafers. Eventually I come to my senses and dial the police, letting them know what happened. 
 Police show up, arrest the guy and charge him with disorderly conduct, assault, destruction of private property, and public intoxication. Evidently the cops that responded to the call were regulars in the restaurant. 
 To this day,  NOBODY  fucks with Steve. I know I sure as fuck wouldn't.

"I have been dating a guy, let's call him Penis, for well over 2 years now. We live together, we are both full time students, and we both work full time. It wasn't always this way, I really had to twist his arm to attend school and to move away from his hometown and basically to become an adult. 
 After countless arguments and begging him to get a job, he is finally gainfully employed at a local theater and decides to let his friend become our roommate. No big deal, right? Split a 2 bedroom rent 3 was, great. titties. 
 Not so great. The first 2 months was all me. Getting all of the deposits in my name, paying all of the bills, going into debt to support two adult men who wanted to sit around and get high all day and bitch and not clean the fucking house.

I asked him to stop, multiple times, and it got to the point where he just stopped telling me that he was stealing, but he continued to steal. It would be about $300-$500/week, at a minimum wage job. 
 So we get evicted because his friend doesn't want to pay anything, so his friend tucks his tail between his legs and goes running home to mommy to solve all his problems. 
 I find a new place, and give Penis a second chance at living with me. This entire time, I am still trying to be a full time fucking student with a serious science degree, not some pansy liberal arts bullshit I am seeking a degree that will provide for myself and my future family and my future fucking retirement. My fucking life. 
 So I had paid everything and decided to take out some student loans so I could focus on school and not work my ass off. I quit smoking, too, hoping to save a little money but it didn't help because Penis was blowing assloads of money on cigarettes and weed and he had to keep up this lifestyle by stealing from his employer. 
 At the beginning of December, Penis tells me he wouldn't have to steal as much if I would pick up more shifts. I had dropped down to weekends in September and was still making enough with my loans and my job to pay my entire portion of the bills, so I really couldn't figure out why someone who worked full time still needed to steal? But okay, whatever. 
 During this time I also applied (and got approved) for foodstamps so that would be even LESS of an expense coming out of our pockets. 
 Anyways, the week before finals I begin working full time again, trying to study and work was a bitch but I scraped by with my average grades, and he does not quit stealing. That's right folks, he guilted me into picking up more shifts, and then didn't hold up his end of the bargain! 
 So Penis made employee of the month that month, and managed to get himself fired at the same time. He got caught, and now he has to pay back EVERYTHING that he stole, which averages out to around $3,000. Which is a lot for 2 broke motherfuckers on foodstamps who make about $13,000/year combined. 
 The foodstamps situation didn't work out, though, because he didn't turn his bank information in on time so they cancelled it after the first fucking month. 
 Here I am, the fool that I am, sitting alone on New Years Eve because Penis decided to wait until I went to bed before leaving me to go out and celebrate with his friends. 
 Penis also failed all of his classes that he's taken over the past 2 years. Every single one of them. And Penis decided that it would be cool if I just covered the rent this month so he could buy stuff like beer to go drink with his friends.",3578,Don't date a penis.,19,0.92153662443161,0.9734283089637756,0.0333050452172756,0.0233693346381187,0.8805418610572815,0.7971799969673157,0.0035374809522181,0.0023317425511777,0.4792714715003967,0.2990705668926239,0.0217301864176988,0.0147941838949918,"""I have been dating a guy, let's call him Penis, for well over 2 years now.

"Basically, this guy I had been seeing wanted to have sex with me without a condom and I said no. He got on top of me anyway. I said, ""no (name), seriously"" and he entered me anyway. I started crying and he was like ""why are you acting so weird? You're the weirdest broad I've ever met and I've dated a LOT of girls."" I kept saying no but he just ignored or kept saying ""please just a little bit"".
I pushed him off and said ""what the fuck is wrong with you? Why can't you take no as an answer?"" and he continued to jack off above me and said ""Well, I'm taking it as a no that really means yes."" I didn't even know what to say. I think I was just like ""...what? It means NO. Don't you understand how rapey this sounds?"" and he was like ""Are you mad at me? Listen, I'll try to take it as a SERIOUS no next time, okay?"" 
 Some more background: earlier in the night he said ""I like you"" and I laughed just because he really doesn't know me yet. I had only seen him a couple times. After that he was like ""Why can't you just believe the nice things that I say to you? I'm trying to be nice. Do you want me to be not nice?"" So while he was jacking off above me he kept murmuring ""Am I allowed to like you? Can I say that I like you?"" in reference to earlier. 
 Also, he said ""You need to start taking me more seriously""
Now. Here is why I'm confused: 
 
 If a friend told me this happened to them I would have thought the same thing. But my feelings inside are making me doubt myself. I was attracted to him and I would have slept with him if he put the condom on. I said no because I was scared of STDs (he's been with about 100 women, not that that's bad it's just more risky) not necessarily because I didn't want to sleep with him beforehand. So that's why I said no. 
 
 I can't even explain this without sounding like a nut but he is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT when he's not horny. He's so nice after he finishes that it makes me feel crazy. He said all this bad shit and then rolls over and cheerfully is like ""How did your tests go this week? I bet you kill em"". It makes me feel crazy. Like I started thinking, did I imagine what just happened? Am I overdramatizing this? 
 
 I don't feel like, shattered or anything. I just feel kind of dead. I don't want to talk to anyone I know. Like I cried right after but since this morning I've just been in bed not really feeling anything. 
 
 I feel I brought this on myself because he was too forward with sex last time. The whole reason I saw him again was to talk about that. He promised he'd scale back and a couple hours later this happened. I was stupid to see him again. 
 
 None of my friends who know what happened have checked in really. One friend picked me up (thank god) and I was bawling but since she's only texted me about how a guy she's dating hasn't rescheduled another date with her. 
 
 I don't know if he went all the way in (TMI ahead), I was really dry so it felt like in high school science when you try and put a glass tube through a rubber stopper. But I hurt down there. 
 
 I feel more ""traumatized"" about the things that were said to me during rather than the actual act because the act didn't last long. 
 
 
 Anyway, I lied and said I had an emergency and bolted. I would've told him off but I was scared that if he won't accept a no for sex why should I expect him to accept a no for leaving his house. Now he's texting me and I don't know what to do. He knows where I live and go to school. I fucked everything up.

"So at the time lived in a pretty decent part of town. My parents had gotten evicted and i was crashing at a friends place. his dad was a communist/etc/fuck the system hippie type guy, and completely didn't give a shit if i crashed there. 
 Up the street were a couple of crappy rental houses. they were surrounded on all sides by nice houses, and relatively expensive condos/apartments. it was really, really out of place. 
 but to get to the meat of it, a lot of fucking  weird  shit happened there, or in front of there. i didn't realize this until we started buying ganja from them out of convenience. 
 i once saw one of the guys from there chase a bunch of people out of the house with a broom handle and a baseball bat for hiding in his attic and taking a bunch of acid. ""THIS ISN'T A FUCKING FRY HOUSEEEE"", kinda weird for the area, but ok. 
 This was the kind of place where everyone had a pitbull, and there was always dog shit all over the floor, next to 12 people crashed out. there was a blind guy with a baby, and all kinds of other weird shit. the entire, extremely large backyard was filled with a thick layer of garbage bags since they never paid any utilities. i'm talking like waist height deep. 
 Then one day they decided to start charging money for, and throwing huge dance parties/raves in their house. they'd nail a ""$8 ADMISSION"" sign up on the porch and there would be huge lines of people. they'd get massive pa systems, tons of djs, lights, fog machines, lasers, all of it. somehow the cops never seemed to show up. 
 the whole place was owned by this weird old deadhead who lived in the rear sunporch and hung out with a few other old deadheads smoking hash and playing old records. he was known only as ""fire"", and looked like willie nelson if willie nelson smoked crack all day. he also had a failure of a son who had a bunch of infected facial piercings and always begged my boss for a job. 
 the real clincher though, was one time my boss(i was flipping burgers at the time nearby, total loserfest both employees and clientele) asked me to go grab him a sack. so i walk over, and walk through the place and it seems like no one is there. 
 eventually someone directs me to the basement, and i'm greeted by the sight of one of the most horrifying displays of.. anything, i've ever seen. the basement was full of garbage bags. like FULL. it had a real high ceilling, maybe 10 feet. unusually high for a basement and the shit was piled right up the ceiling at the edges. in the middle it was maybe a foot or two deep with only a bit of free floor space. 
 all over the bags of garbage, and the floor, were seemingly middle school and early highschool age kids all jugallod and ravered out fucking going at it in a  massive orgy . probably at least 30 of them, with a few gross older stragglers probably in their 20s. there was music blasting, and the entire place just absolutely reeked of shit, garbage, and fucking. ball sweat and vagina exhaust mixed in with rotting food, and human and dog shit. the windows were steamed up. 
 i was completely fucking shocked, i couldn't even move. just stuck going :O. one of the guys who recognized me said something along the lines of ""HEY TJ, THIS GUY WANTS A SACK"" 
 one of the guys turns around and pulls out of the chick he's banging, picks up his backpack from the pile of garbage, and walks over to me and just nonchalantly pulls out a couple bags, takes my money, and walks right back over. to be clear, he did zip up his pants.

"I know ultimately you control your life.. but sometimes you get dealt a shitty situation that is out of your control. Or you make a small mistake and get royally fucked for it. 
 For me, it was when I was 17. 
 My girlfriend's little sister at the time was getting sexually harassed at my high school when I was a senior. She was a freshman. The pervert was a junior. He put his hands up her shirt and other girls skirts all the time I learned from this girl while I was at her house visiting my girlfriend. She had told me not to tell a single soul about it though and never talk to the guy. She made it sound like it wasn't a big deal and this was just how this guy was and nothing could change it no matter how many times she or other girls told him to stop. 
 Well, one day I saw him put his hands up a girls shirt at lunch and I was shocked. I rarely see this kid and the one time I see him after my conversation with the girl, I see him doing the offense to some random girl. I was infuriated. 
 So, I confronted him about it. He kept denying that he knew this girl I was talking about. Every time I said her name, he just said, ""who?"". I could tell he was scared. He was much taller than me but I had the size and the look of someone you didn't want to fuck with at that moment. He continued to lie his ass off so I basically snapped and beat the shit out of him. Turns out guys who are sexual predators on freshman girls can't fight back at all.. and it was pretty much just me pummeling his face and head for the next two minutes. I actually ended up breaking my hand on the back of his head from him balling up in a standing position. Presumably the same position many girls had taken when he forced his his hands up their shirts. When they pulled me off him he screamed ""wtf man what did I do to you"" in front of all the kids watching (about a crowd of 30 people). I couldn't believe the gall on this pervert that he would try to convince the crowd he did nothing wrong. I yelled at the top of my lungs ""If you ever touch her again I will fucking kill you"". That shut him up and you could tell he just wanted me to keep quiet at that point. 
 He never did it again at that school and eventually was so ashamed he transferred schools. 
 Shitty part was? I was expelled half way through my senior year a long with a assault and battery charge. I had never even had a single infraction at the school prior to that. I couldn't believe it. Worst part was the cop who arrested me on campus screamed at me as to why I beat him up. I told him because he was touching girls younger than him and putting his hands up the shirt of my girlfriends little sister who was a freshman. He continued to yell at me and said I should have reported it to the school even after the girl told me not to report it since it would embarrass the fuck out of her. I pretty much told him to fuck off and he is an asshole for telling me that. 
 Before the pervert transferred schools he was actually suspended two days for sexual harassment because about 7 girls came to the school office in my defense telling them that ""Yes, I have been sexually harassed by this kid too on a regular basis."" The kids parents even tried to sue my parents for the hospital bill and psychology sessions due to the fight but my girlfriends dad stopped that by going to the parents house and telling him he would sue them for their kid sexually harassing his little girl. He was a millionaire so they dropped that issue in a heartbeat.

"America Fuck Yeah, has turned into America... Fuck.  This gets a touch rambling, but there is a point to it all. 
 While I don't think traveling to Mars is worth bankrupting every single Earthling ( which would be impossible but that's a long discussion)  America is supposedly one of the richest nations on the earth.  We spend  700 billion dollars on the military and 18 billion on NASA.   Now 18 billion is a shit ton of money (actual measurement in metric).  And I'd rather cut the military budget down than just shift it all to NASA (though NASA deserves a good hike)   But let's be honest, our space program is in the shitter. 
 Last I heard (and this was a couple years ago) we don't have the money to build the new shuttles that NASA was planning.  I don't know the exact day to day status but we're spending 5 years minimum to get the new Space Launch System underway.  That's scary.  (I would hate to be the people on the ISS right now.  I'm sure other countries visit but that's still a fucked up position... see you in 5 years! LOL) 
 As a country we should decide do we believe in life on other planets.  If we do, we need to continue to develop a space program and look at mars and beyond.  Who knows what we'll find, who knows when alien life will contact us.  If they do, I'd like use to show we're at least competent enough to keep searching. 
 But the reason I'm pissed isn't because for this isn't ""Sci fi"" it's for ""Sci fact"".  Look at the vast improvements we've gained just from a 10 year rush to the moon.  The reason for this is numerous but we had a necessity to build better, stronger, smaller, and faster.  Computer technology alone grew in massive proportions,  Plastics, engines, even communication was push to the limits.  Why?  Because we believed it was necessary and we had the money to burn.  Do you know what percentage of the budget we devoted to going to the moon?  2 to 5 Percent.  Three percent on average.  Currently we give it .5 percent.  At the height when cool ass science was being done?  More than double what we pay now on an adjusted monetary scale. 
 Imagine what technology we will need to get to the Mars.  Imagine what technology we'll need to make the first moon base.   Imagine if we find an emission-less life on the moon or a way to live in perfect coexistence so our emissions CO2 emissions would be able to be reduced to nothing by plant life so we can live in a perfect environment for years in outer space. 
 I'm not saying we will massively benefit from a Mars trip, we might not.  It might be a huge waste.  But it's more likely going to be the best way to advance science light years ahead.  Currently on earth we are inventing convenience due to desire.  But when you look at some of the problems that space exploration offer, you start looking at a whole new set of problems and constraints and instead of ""a faster smart phone"" you'll instead invent a ""smart phone that can last 6 months with out a charge""  And that's the type of shit that we really need.  not just the next generation of iPhone with a little fake AI.   You change the paradigm from ""What will consumers buy?"" to ""What do consumers need?"" 
 Final thought:  the personal computer was a joke before the 60s.  Computers were big as trucks.  But miniaturization mostly from the space race allowed the idea of each person owning a personal computer, not a terminal but an actual fully functioning computer in their house.

"I mean we're talking about billions of dollars of equipment flying into  space  motherfuckers!! That shit ain't cheap and space is fucking dangerous. It's essentially a metal coffin being fired out of a canon, it takes a lot of engineering, time and money to even make it this safe. 
 So why am I taking anyone and everyone to Mars? Let's just say I've arranged a pot fuelled sex orgy, the best kind of orgy this side of Uranus. Now wait, I'm hearing about all these fundamentalist X-tians, some nut jobs who happen to be religious nut jobs, doesn't matter. Anyway, I heard that after stoning some girl to death and bombing a couple of abortion clinics they're going to sneak onto one of my millions of space flights and kill absolutely everyone on board. 
 Why millions of space flights? I think you may be underestimating how legendary this pot fuelled sex romp is gonna be moi sun! 
 So anyway, how do I make these flights safe? I mean everyone that wants to fly with me knows they're taking some risk but they expect me not to just let these wannabe murderers onto my space ship, enough shit can go wrong with my ships as it is. 
 Well obviously I'll x-ray all their luggage and confiscate anything weird that I have a reasonable and logical reason to be wary off. I've done my research and you can make a bomb out of a LOT of household shit. I'm more concerned about a nut blowing a small hole in my ship, instantly crashing and killing 300 nice people, but 1 guy with a knife can be subdued and really, he could probably kill with his hands if he needed to, so I can't hope to stop that kind of thing. But bombs, hell yeah I want to stop those. 
 So now what, luggage is safe, what about the person? Can I X-ray them too? I just want to check for weapons/bombs, not be pervy, I've got the fucking Mars any-holes-a-goal-athon for that. But X-rays are dangerous of course, what about ultrasounds!!? They give those to fucking pregnant women'n'shit, they've gotta be safe. Plus people don't mind a doctor checking out your junk or even YOUR KIDS JUNK if it's to be safe and concerned about your health and safety. Even though, you know, being a doctor doesn't imply anything about their moral fibre and/or perv factor. It's a job, it is noble to want to heal people but it is not a requirement to pass your fucking exams. 
 So yeah, some sort of harmless method of checking to see if you have any dangerous ways to murder your fellow passengers, check :) 
 But wait, what?!? People don't like this. What else can I fucking do? You know a tiny percentage of people would blow up this space orgy trip if they could, how can I stop them? Well, I could let you people choose another option but my hands are kinda tied here. Seriously, any suggestions would be helpful, short of checking you for weapons like millions of police officers do everyday....what? You want to do that? Seriously you guys...seriously. 
 Okay, fine. So this is an objection that kinda looks askew in the eyes of a 150year old piece of paper. Fine, they had plenty of great ideas back then. But, you know, I don't think they could imagine a 1/2 pound of liquid explosives detonating on a pot fuelled, orgy bound space trip to Mars, causing tons of wreckages and body parts to rain down on an innocent metropolitan population causing untold death and destruction. But fine, so WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT ME TO DO??!? CAUSE I AIN'T HEARING A BETTER OPTION. SHUT UP OR NUT UP YOU FUCKING WHINY REDDIT BITCHES.

"I have been with my girlfriend for a while now and she is alright. I know she would never cheat on me, but I really don't feel super attracted to her. She doesn't demand a lot from me, but then again I don't feel compelled to please her. 
 Reasons I don't like my girlfriend: 
She is a complainer, really bad 
She nags me all the time for stupid shit, like leaving my tools out and how my stuff is in her way 
She hardly ever initiates sex, and if I deny her when she does - it is the end of the world. 
She is only a 6/10, she is not fat at all, but her ass is kinda flabby and her butt and legs have the cellulose look. She will talk about how she is going to run and loose weight blah blah and how her birth control made her fat and her boobs hurt because they got bigger, and she talks about how she used to have abs. In reality she is just lazy and always acts like she is going to attempt to lose weight but fails to follow through. 
She freaks out, not to the point of an anxiety attack, but it is bad enough to piss me off 
She is really clumsy, as in she breaks everything and drops her phone at least once a day 
 Me vs. Her: 
I am calm / she is high stress ; nothing makes me freak out, I just take what life gives me and make the best of it 
I am smart (I know everything about everything because I constantly learn all day - although my ADHD brain makes me do this) and she is a sheep, as in she just takes life with a grain of salt and is scared to do anything or try to learn anything 
When I get into something - I really get into it / she just seems lazy to me, and she doesn't know how to follow through with anything. aka: a quitter, a person who wines about how they wish they would have done stuff that they were given the opportunity to do, but was too lazy and quit 
I know what I want to do with my life / she is so lost and always talks about how she is scared of what career to do (blah blah blah - i say this because she says it all the time, but doesn't attempt to research/ do anything about it) 
I am an introvert and she is an extrovert / I am very logical and she is very emotional - I don't need other people to be happy (this is a problem because I NEED my alone time, but she CRAVES my attention) 
 On the flipside she is sweet and not dumb. She knows how to study and get good grades.  She thinks I am hilarious. She is not afraid to work a job. Her parents are awesome. She is responsible (AKA takes her birth control every day and the EXACT same time). 
 But she really stresses me the fuck out. I don't like to be stressed. My deadlines are lazy because I don't plan my life ahead of time. I also don't want to be 24/7 cleaning, as I have better things to do. (NO I a not a slob ;D) I am outgoing and I like to try new things, but she is annoyingly scared of everything. 
She loves me, but sometimes I don't know if I love her. The bad thing is that I am too good of a person to stand up for myself and do what I want. I hate being an asshole and upsetting people and for her to be happy she needs me. 
I have dated hotter girls and one really broke my heart. As a high school senior I found out my most recent ex was cheating on me for over a year. I kind of lost my ability to love the way I once did. I act like an asshole and occasionally act sweet, but not like the way I once did. 
 It is just hard. I feel trapped, but we still have fun. I am so conflicted with how I feel really. I will probably marry her and live my whole life like this. Secretly miserable, but too nice to break her heart. Sometimes I cry over this whole situation, but hey what can you do. So what do you guys think about my relationship? I am sure my story is highly biased, but it is just how I perceive the whole thing.",3740,"I am calm. She is high stress. I am an introvert.

"Me and a buddy hit up this nerdy shin dig just off our campus. The local gaming group was throwing some kind of holiday party, and we had already made a point of going anywhere with free alcohol.  Anyway, we get to the apartment, and it's packed wall to wall with all manner of socially awkward human beings. Grab a few drinks, starting to get sort of fucked up, someone somewhere passes around a bong, and we're both pretty much set to go. Then, for whatever reason, my room mate shows up to the same party. Walks up to me with a pill shaped capsule in hand, about the size of a quarter and says ""Hey, what does this smell like to you?"". Now, Im not going to lie, I am an impulsive individual, and am prone to not exactly think things through whilst enjoying the silly juice. So, I look him dead in the eye, ear to ear grin, and snort the ever loving shit out of whatever was in that capsule. Initially, I couldn't smell anything, which I told him, then proceeded to snort it again, thinking in my drunken haze that perhaps I just didn't do it hard enough the first time. Now this asshole is flabbergasted, as if he DIDNT think I was going to do exactly what I just did. And I'm still smiling, even as the right side of my face turns bright red. Immediately after the change in skin tone, I start to notice the tickling sensation running itself up and down my nasal passageway. And by tickling sensation, I mean THE BLOODY FIRES OF HELL. I swear to Christ, it was as though I had just snorted hot coals. At this point, my right eye tears up, the right half of my face is in agony, and Im laughing my ass off because I'm a fucking moron. In between bouts of ""Im going to break your fucking arms"" to my room mate, I manage to lace my profanity with the curious question ""DA FUCK DID I JUST SNORT!?""  to which he replies ""Pure Capsaicin"". Now I knew what this stuff was at the time, but for those of you in the cheap seats who do not know what capsaicin is, in short it is the chemical compound in peppers that causes them to be hot. It's pure scoville heat condensed into a crystalline structure, which to me seemed a hell of allot more like a powder than a crystal. Anyway, after a few more death threats, I make my way up to the bar. My friend who came with me is laughing his drunk ass off, and Im pretty sure I said I'd kill him too. Anyway, at the bar, in between bouts of laughter, cries of agony and scattered profanity, I proceed to ask the strangest question I've ever asked a bartender, ""I swear to god, I am not fucking with you, but do you have any milk I can snort?"". Well, the bartender thinks this is a less than elaborate joke and starts laughing, which in turn makes everyone else in the apartment laugh. I chuckle and respond with, ""no, seriously, got milk?"", and again, more raucous laughter, followed finally by ""NO YOU GUT WRENCHING PIECES OF SHIT, DO YOU HAVE ANY FUCKING MILK!?"". Well, needless to say, this got their attention, and the bartender handed me a sonic the hedgehog shot glass of the 1% cow juice. I make my way to the bathroom, followed close behind by my ginger headed fuck of a friend, and start to snort the shit over the sink. I don't know if any of you have ever snorted a liquid before, but its fucking abysmal, and it carries whatever the hell else is in your nose down your throat with it. So the burning continued, all the way down my gullet. I spent a solid half hour snorting milk in this bathroom, trying to make the burning in my nostril go away, which thankfully it did, but not without some serious discomfort. I never killed my room mate, even though he probably deserved it. Then again, I think I've learned a valuable lesson from this whole debacle, and I wish to impart that lesson to you, my lovely internet folk. Capsaicin. Not even once.",3794,Snorted Capsaicin.

"I lived with these cunts about a month ago in a college dorm who would be all up my ass for every little thing I did.  I only lived with them for 2 weeks before the passive aggressive notes, and openly aggressive crazy psycho's got me to leave. 
 Here's how it went down.  My boyfriend took someone's plate from the kitchen without asking.  The girl was SO offended (even though we cleaned it off, returned it and said we were really sorry and that it wouldn't happen again) that she told me and my boyfriend that if we ever laid a finger on anything of hers ever again she'd get the RA's and police involved.  It became her sick mission to make me as uncomfortable as possible in the suite.  I would leave a dish in the sink for I dunno a day I'd get 5 post it notes on my door telling me ""WE'RE NOT UR MAIDS OMG CLEAN UR FUCKING BLUE DISH"" No joke.  One of them actually took it upon herself to clean the dish and leave it at my door every single time I left it in there for more than 5 hours. 
 Then I started getting friendly little notes like ""Give back my kitchen knife I know you stole it!!"" Like, I never touched your goddamn fucking knife this is college 1,000 people could have been in here to steal it... jesus christ. 
 The bitch actually walked up to me, looked me square in the eye and said, ""You know smoking weed is illegal right?""  I was like... ""yeah... obviously."" and she was like ""well you better be REAL fucking careful because its illegal and it'd be a shame if anything happened.""  Like WTF I don't smoke THAT often and I use a fan, fabreeze, towel the door in my room.  Leave me the fuck alone I pay $20,000 a year to fucking live here.  I don't tell you not to cook your smelly shitty curry food and stink up the whole suite just because I catch a whiff of it and go ""ew stinky!"" ... Some people just can't handle momentary uncomfortableness though I guess catching a whiff of reefer at 11pm on a friday night is too unbearable for you. 
 These are the type of cunts these cunts were: Someone left old milk in the fridge (not me) and instead of throwing out the milk and fucking moving on with their lives they left it in there for AS LONG AS FUCKING POSSIBLE to make a point that they were obviously far superior human beings for throwing out milk before it spoils.  They would write things like ""OMG IT STINKS"" on the fridge instead of just throwing it out.  So one day I threw it out and left a note that said something like ""I threw out the milk.  It wasn't mine but I threw it out anyway because I'm not the type of person who keeps spoiled milk in the fridge for 2 months to prove a point.  Just do that next time."" 
 That really got their shit kicking.  There were full rageface now derping along trying to fuck up my day constantly. 
 So it all culminated in this bullshit meeting with the R.A.'s who were gonna come talk to all of us and deal with the ""problem"" in our suite... which as we all know was clearly me at this point.  So once I saw a note on the fridge that said: ""Mandatory meeting, we have to deal with ""the situation"" on the fridge I left a note back saying ""I won't make your garbage meeting, you've done nothing but make my life hell since I got here I'm moving out the ""situation"" is dealt with -Toodles Bitches."" and I got the fuck out of there... 
 The real kicker is after all that bullshit, when I went to go switch rooms the R.A.'s told me to fill out a complaint that what they did sounded like harassment.  So they all got a talking to about how to deal with people... like, you can't call the cops on someone who borrowed a plate.  Period.

"Not using a throw away, fuck it, I don't care if she reads this. Depending on replies, I might send this thread to her. 
 My sister has been a truck driver for the last three or four years, starting out over the road and finally landing a ""local"" job a couple years ago. It pays really well, and she finally got her own place away from our very religious paranoid schizophrenic mother. 
 As most of you probably know, truck driving takes up the majority of your life. I didn't see her for months at a time when she first started, and I thought that things would be better once she got a local gig. 
 It was at first, but she started as an on call driver (still is for the most part as far as I know,) and they basically abused her mercilessly because she never says no. She's pretty introverted, and while not afraid to tell people off, she doesn't always speak up. Also, I think she's kinda obsessed with making money. 
 She works 60 + hours a week, and is out of town a lot. I think I might see her less now then when she was over the road. 
 I was mildly concerned at first, thinking that once she'd been there a while her hours would mellow out. I could tell she was tired, but she is a very secretive person, and sometimes feels the need to hide the strangest things. 
 Still, not too bad. But then I notice her drinking... a lot. Looking for any excuse to drink. ""We should get drunk this weekend!"" ""Let's go eat at Yard House and get drunk!"". We may be twenty somethings, but regular heavy drinking is not something either of us have ever done. Alcoholism and mental illness run in my mom's side of the family, and she always warned us to be careful when drinking. 
 I was a little more concerned, but chalked it up to a phase. Then she started dating a guy from her work (imho work place romance is a bad idea, but to each his own.) Turns out he also drinks... a lot. 
 It turns out just about all the truck drivers I've heard about drink a lot too. Her drinking has gotten considerably worse since she's now dating a fellow truck driver that drinks a lot. Whenever she's off she's with him and they are both getting shit faced. 
 So now I see her even less, and when I do, things feel weird. I'm not sure how to describe it. She almost seems furtive. She'll tell me, ""If you had my job you'd drink too."" As if that makes it OK. 
 We're really close in age, and are close enough in appearance that people often mistake us for twins. We were extremely close growing up. I was the assertive, adventurous, outgoing one, her the more quite, introverted and shy one. It taught me how to communicate better with introverted people and tone down my ""loud"" personality with them. We complement each other nicely. 
 So I knew, even though she never talked about it, that she was NOT doing well at all. If we went to eat, she'd have multiple drinks. It didn't matter what time of the day it was, if I call her and she's not driving, she'd be drunk a good majority of the time. She's always got a bottle of tequila around the house, usually half empty. 
 One night out of the blue, she drunk texts me about how tried and unhappy she is, that no one knows how hard she works. That she's had some close calls at work because she's so tired, so she took out 1 million dollars in life insurance. I tell her no amount of money is worth it, quit, sleep on my couch for however long she needs to, and finally go do what she wants to do - go to highway patrol school. 
 But she just says she needs more money. And that was about the end of it. It was weird how many times she reiterated that.

"Hello /r/sex. I've been cumming fast as long as I can remember, whether that be from pornography, blowjobs, sex with a condom, sex with a condom with desensitizing lubricant (it has worked occasionally but not reliably), sex without a condom. All of the above. 
 The only method I've found successful in dealing with this issue over the last 7 years is getting fairly drunk (largely before meeting the girl I'm seeing that night) to the point of almost guaranteeing whiskey dick before having sex. In a drunk enough state I'm generally able to last for 10-15 minutes with 70% of the time a half-stiffy, or the lucky 20% a raging hard on, or the last 10% busting in a couple minutes despite it all. 
 As you can imagine, I've had to satisfy previous girlfriends and fwb's I've been with by becoming fairly accomplished at foreplay/fingering. If I'm sober and it's getting around that time I'll let girls know what the deal with my penis is in advance, and assure that despite my issues I'll do my absolute utmost to get their rocks off before they even touch me. I haven't yet met someone who has walked out after my confession, but for the first time a week ago I had an encounter with a girl who didn't want to meet again or remain in contact afterwards. She made it clear that despite it being enjoyable my mouth wasn't a good enough substitute for my cock. 
 I have lurked on this subreddit for a long time without posting, and seen my share of PE posts asking for help. I have delayed posting myself, likely because I was in a long-term relationship (years) with a girl who unfortunately had very little sex drive and negative association towards most things past foreplay. I assumed that eventually both my situation and hers would get better with practice, and it didn't (seriously fuck fanatical upbringings). I should've posted earlier, now my dick/mental state/whatever the fuck is wrong with me has finally bit me in the ass and here we are. 
 If you asked me 2 years ago, my guesses as to the root of the problem (based on my Googling to the causes of PE) would be: 
 
 Anxiety - From college, from a parent passing away, from a strained relationship with the other parent, from being head-over-heels for a girl yet having sex so infrequently, from knowing deep down that I'm a 2 pump-chump. 
 
 Physical health - been skinny to average body weight with lower muscle mass, saying up late chugging caffeine drinks to make it through exams. 
 
 Lack of PIV practice (side effect of being with a low-libido SO). 
 
 
 Now I can say safely say issues 2 & 3 have more-or-less been dealt with. For the past 2.5 years since ending my relationship I've gone to the gym 4 times a week and am in the best shape of my life. I've managed to cut sugar and all shit food out of my diet, and since ending my relationship (and maybe looking better as a result of this healthier lifestyle?) I've dated girls every month since and had sexual encounters regularly. And I'm still having these problems. 
 I've tried edging, stop-start, taking it slow, trying to fuck all day, lubricants, masturbating 6 times the day of -- literally everything except kegels, reverse-kegels and medication. No matter what I try, my dick has a mind of its own. If you can put yourself in my shoes, the most embarrassing experience to myself was using special climax-control spray on my dick, in combination with a climax control lubricant condom, whilst being totally fucking annihilated drunk to the point that I was almost spinning. I busted in 2 minutes. Am I fucking broken? 
 I honestly want to try to avoid doing kegels, so with that in mind /r/sex I ask you this: do you have any insight for me? Were you or do you know someone who got over PE? Were they successful with using some sort've medication/Viagra/antidepressant/SSRI to deal with this issue? Should I go to a urologist (my family doctor retired) or can any doctor deal with this?",3920,"1 paragraph up.

"As the title says, Fuck Toshiba. 
 Over the July 4th weekend, I bought a new bed. As part of a promotion, the bed came with a free 32"" LCD TV by Toshiba. I was psyched! Free TV FTW! 
 A few days later (July 13) I picked up a FedEx package from Toshiba and unwrapped my shiny new TV. Eagerly, I plugged in the new HD cable box I'd gotten specifically for the new box. 
 Nothing. No picture. Nothing. Turns out the TV was defective. 
 I'm thinking this isn't going to be a big deal - I'd call Toshiba and they'd apologize and then send me a replacement. I called. After the menu system hung up on me 3 or 4 times because it couldn't understand the difference between D and B or C when I read out my serial number and then 45 minutes of hold time I finally talked to a real person. 
 The rep I spoke with apologized but then transferred me to a different company who Toshiba uses for in home service. In home service? WTF? Ok, ok, I'm reasonable. If I have to have someone come in to my home to fix my 32"" TV, so be it. Because it's, you know, the fucking 50s. 
 I wait a week and a tech comes out. ""Yup, the screen is broken. I'll have to order a part."" Ok, again, I'm reasonable. I figure he'll be back in a week or so and I'll be up and running. Sure the wife had to take a day off of work to wait for the tech, but whatever. 
 Fast forward 3 weeks. I get a call from the repair place telling me the part won't be in until SEPTEMBER. It is now the beginning of August. 
 I have now moved passed anger and rage to full on fury. I call Toshiba again and finally talk my way into speaking with a case manager. Elizabeth the Case Manager tells me that while she's sorry about the inconvenience, I have to wait at least 1 month (30 days) after a part was ordered before the TV can be replaced. She tells me to call back in a week and I'll be shipped a new TV. 
 A week after speaking to Elizabeth (that bring us to yesterday) I called Toshiba's pool of useless case managers yet again. Another half hour on hold and I'm told by another case manger that today is not my day. No new TV for OtisTheZombie. 
 I flipped. He says, ""I'm sorry, I know this is frustrating."" 
 I retorted, ""If you were actually sorry you'd fix the fucking problem instead of being so goddamned obtuse! How hard is it for you to put a TV in a fucking box, put my address on the fucking box, and put the fucking box in the fucking mail?!"" 
 ""I understand your concerns. You can call back tomorrow, or I can have the original case manager who promised you the new TV call you tomorrow."" 
 ""So far everything you have told me is a lie. Why should I believe you that Elizabeth is going to call me back? But sure. Have her call me."" 
 Fast forward to today. No call. She only works till 2PM, so I called Toshiba back myself. Unfortunately I was at work so I was unable to unleash my white-hot fury upon them. 
 I was very rational and personable with the retard (case manager) that I spoke with today. He ""understood my concerns"" and knew how my problem could be frustrating. I told him that there was no way in hell he understood how frustrated I was. If I could shit out a nuclear bomb on their faces, I would. 
 Finally he starts going in the direction I want - replacing the motherfucking TV. BUT NO! WAIT! THERE'S MORE. 
 Now I have to wait 5 - 7 Motherfucking Business Days for the ""order desk"" to call me back and ""discuss my options."" Discussing options sounds distinctly like them not giving me a new TV. I even asked to wait on hold, but he wouldn't fucking transfer me. 
 What can I do? I have no store to return it to. The mattress dealer has told me it's not their problem, and the repair center can't do shit until they get the part from Toshiba! The Case Managers won't let me speak to their bosses and there's nobody else they'll transfer me to. If I could reach through the phone and strangle a case manager I'd probably feel better, but I'd still be out one motherfucking television.

"Male: 21. 
 Is sex devalued in our society? Look, I understand that EVERYONE has the option to decide who they fuck and when, and how much and for how long. Or even, how many partners. That’s not the point. I see sex going in a direction where it’s just something people do when they are horny and attracted to another person. But, where’s the value in that? Why is it that we think that it’s just something you do, yet, at the same time, everyone I know who’s ever got cheated on has always been outraged? What’s the difference if your girlfriend Sue goes and fucks Bill? It’s just another thing we do. Why as a society is it being ingrained into people’s mind now that sex isn’t about connecting and sharing a moment with someone, and instead about getting your rocks off? I shouldn’t be one to talk, I’ve fallen victim to this mentality. I had always planned to keep my number as low as possible. I got to college, was drunk, and horny, shut this girl down all night beyond making out with her, and then drunker me allowed myself to go to her room with her where we proceeded to fuck. I felt gross afterwards, because I didn’t like her, and barely knew her. Somewhere along the line I lost sight of sex as being something I shared with another person who I (probably) liked, and just became a game of banging as many girls as possible. Part of it was about bragging, part of it was about competing, and none of it was because I actually cared about any of them. (Okay, I cared about 2 of them, they were both girlfriends). But why is it, that we live in a society where, a girl will have sex with someone they don’t like at all, know almost nothing about them, but make someone that they “really like wait” to have sex with them? How do you think that the guy perceives this? I’ll tell you in brief; they aren’t good enough, not as hot, and the girl wasn’t willing to take a risk that he might not stick around, so she obviously didn’t consider him a high value male with a lot of options. 
 Now, I have to ask, with being able to “have” sex so easily, I think I’m beginning to miss the entire point of having a relationship anymore. What’s the point? The sex is something I can have with anyone. Sure, I may not feel those feels of being super close to someone or “making love” but I can still have sex. I know relationships aren’t ALL about sex, but let’s not FOOL ourselves into thinking a sexless relationship will work for the MAJORITY of people. I can go out, meet a Sue, have sex with her, continue to have sex with her, and then peace out when she wants some commitment. (After she told me all along she would NEVER like me, and NEVER want anything besides my dick). Now sex is nothing special, it’s something I’ve had with so many people, it brings me to wonder what the point is besides an orgasm. 
 Then there’s always the other aspect of it that brings about insecurity. What does it mean that my (non-existent) girlfriend, Sue has been so attracted to someone that she fucked them within an hour? Or that she got banged out in the bathroom stall by some stranger at the bar? Or that the guy she had sex with once was better at it than I, who have had sex with her 100 times has ever been? Or that another dude used her to get his nut then pulled out and nutted on her face and made jokes about it with his friends? How do I ever get over the look of frustration on Sue's face when I come early, or when she tells me to ""fuck her like a normal person"" does? 
 To be honest though, I'm almost coming to the point of being afraid to have sex with girls because I'm worried about performing. I'm worried about being compared. I'm worrying about being bad. I'm worried about my penis being too short and what she'll tell her GF's later when they ask about how the sex was, or how big I am. And all of this is effecting my performance now. Nothing seems to help. I'd much rather have a ONS where the sex (and her) mean nothing. There is nothing I have to worry about. I never have to see them again.",4009,bunch of thoughts/insecurities about sex.

"I'm going to wage my own personal war against him 
 This is just a bad idea. The guy's a total asshole for sure, but instead of getting the school involved or cutting off contact with him your solution is to escalate things further? 
 > He gave me a way to kick the shit out of him with minimal consequences. I am planning on taking full advantage of it. 
 Right, because the cure-all for every problem is to resort to physical violence. Stop to think for a second about the possible consequences here: You're 18 and can be charged with assault and battery  as an adult . Forget the legal consequences, do you really want to fuck up your chances of getting into the army?! 
 And whereas force may be understandable a) in the heat of the moment, b) in physical defense of yourself or someone else, or c) after trying and failing to get help from an authority figure, this is  none  of those things. Quite the opposite, you will be committing premeditated violence well after the fact, against someone who (despite being a scumbag) hasn't actually hurt anyone, and with the stated intent of skirting any form of justice system. How do you think that's going to look? 
 What's worse, you are literally just announced this intention to the whole world, via a well-known forum on a site with millions of users, on the Internet where as we all know nothing gets erased. Even if no-one makes the connection, what if there's a witness? What if he has his own recorder? 
 Everyone who reads this sub has a hard-on for justice stories where the bad guy gets his ass kicked, but this is real life. You're an adult now, handle your problems like one. In the following order: 
 
 Granuaile needs to talk to him one-on-one and make it incredibly clear that she's not interested in him, never will be, and that his behavior is totally unacceptable. Use simple, firm, and unambiguous wording, without any coddling of his feelings. Leave absolutely no way for him to twist the message into some small bit of hope he can cling to. You can't be there either - he'll think she's saying all that just because you're in the room. 
 
 After saving a record of all the texts and other messages, you both need to block him on every form of communication (phone, facebook, IM, whatever). The other option is to continue recording his messages without actually responding, but (for Granuaile at least) its probably better to avoid all that entirely. 
 
 Get physical distance in school wherever you can. You already partly did this by asking for a different project group, do so wherever else you need to. Avoid him in the lunchroom, blah blah blah. If he tries to initiate contact, walk away from him if possible or just ignore him. 
 
 Involve an authority figure. You don't need to go to the cops, that's overkill at this stage. Go to the school guidance counselor and show him/her the messages and the recording. Get your and Granuaile's parents involved, and his too. I guarantee you this isn't the first time your school has dealt with this kind of harassment and they will probably have procedures in place to deal with it. At the very least a parent-teacher meeting about his unacceptable behavior should get the message across. 
 
 If and only if this doesn't work and he starts to dramatically escalate (showing up at her house for example), then bring in the police. Documented evidence of harassment and repeated failure to heed punitive measures from the school should be enough to get them involved. If a stern warning from a uniformed officer doesn't do the trick, well, they'll handle it from there. 
 
 
 The worst thing you can possibly do in this situation is skip over all of the above and jump straight to a back-alley beating.

"F*ck you b*tch. 
 So yesterday was already a super stressful shift. My first transaction was a bear- you know it's going to be bad when you have to  tell  the customer to start taking her stuff out of bags (a return that lasted a half hour ). Then a short while later, I had a customer with a shitton of items who had no idea how a tax exempt purchase worked besides doing it 'multiple times' according to her big mouth. She was kind enough to put her things on the very edge of the counter, and wouldn't push anything closer to me. She'd just hold items when there wasn't 'any room'. The receipt was LONGER THAN I AM TALL. AND SHE WANTED TWO. At least I didn't run out of paper halfway through that transaction... 
 So now it's about 45 minutes to close. It's really freaking noisy at the front despite the fact that there's only a few customers there. Naturally being the amazing supervisor I am, I try to stand as inconspicuously as possible so the noisy customers don't come over to my blissfully empty line. That's a lie. I'm actually listening to the noisy customers, because they were obnoxious earlier (screaming for someone to bring them a basket among other issues), their transaction has already taken a solid few minutes and they're still not done, plus they're in the line of a bloody lazy and incompetent cashier who consistently refuses to ask for help. All in all a problematic situation. I realise there is a problem and the cashier isn't handling it properly at all, and I jog on over to help before it gets any worse. I and a manager finally get it resolved, transaction is over, but wait! The obnoxious customer wants help with something else! SO THE CASHIER LEAVES AND IGNORES THE CUSTOMER WHO HAD PATIENTLY BEEN WAITING IN LINE. I apologise, take her over to my register, and try and get her checked out as quickly as possible. It's now about half an hour to close and I just want a minute to myself. 
 And then... AND THEN... 
 A woman who was part of the obnoxious customer crew and her son(?) come up with THREE carts filled to the brim. My stomach has simultaneously jumped into my mouth and dropped so far down it went to hell and did a lap dance for Satan. I'm trying to scan and bag things as quickly as possible, but it's a never ending flood of our merchandise, as well as demands for discounts on perfectly good items and an overall discount. I call over a GOOD cashier and we take turns scanning and bagging (and a few times it was all her based on what was going on with the other cashiers and my closing duties). Of course she has a bunch of glass so I have to pull the incompetent cashier and tell her to get boxes (which took entirely too long). After a couple minutes I call the manager up to work a register, because of course we had to get super busy right around closing. Around three HUNDRED items scanned, my machine is becoming sluggish, and at almost 450 items MY MACHINE FROZE. So the lady is 'kind' enough to let the manager scan the rest of her shit (probably another 200), I send the cashier who was helping me back to her register (what a trooper), and I help the manager bag and wrap things while keeping an eye on the time so time sensitive closing things still get done. We actually locked our doors early because anyone who was helping this inconsiderate trash was on the verge of a nuclear meltdown and we weren't dealing with customers shopping after closing. About ten minutes after we should have closed we've finally finished both transactions and helped carry all her things outside (including getting more carts for her because apparently Her Majesty is too good to carry plastic bags or boxes). The manager and I run around trying to finish all the non-time sensitive closing procedures as fast as possible, my trooper cashier and the other good cashier are putting away things and cleaning up the store, and the other cashier... uh, she's 'helping'. 
 We all end up clocking out super late. As we're walking out to the parking lot, what do we see? All those carts we got for that lovely customer and her lovely friends parked NEXT to the cart corral. We left it for the morning shift.",4147,if you know you're buying hundreds of items COME DURING THE DAY NOT RIGHT BEFORE CLOSING,88,0.9809387922286988,0.0013954975875094,0.0660320445895195,9.415352542418988e-05,0.9524461030960084,0.0001740452571539,0.0014053381746634,0.0001152420809376,0.77490234375,0.0001979949593078,0.0065968111157417,0.0001456279860576,Supervisor describes stressful shift at a supermarket.

"A few years back I was in a post breakup low point in my life, and to cope I was hitting up the locals on craigslist. I arrange to come to this girl's place. Would have been the first time meeting her, completely random. Good pics though, several legitimate looking pics, cute face, fit, nurse scrubs so likely educated and working? Seems alright. I'm to come to her apartment for nsa sex, a few laughs, and minimal drama. 
 Wrong....all wrong..... 
 It starts by her giving me the apartment complex name/address but I get radio silence upon arrival. No idea which apt #.  I wait around for a solid 45min before I say fuck it and leave. I get a call back within another hour or so and she says that I ""wasn't her type"". I tell her that if she had met me maybe she would have liked me, etc. I'm staying cool and not aggressive. I get a No to that and I don't beg again or get vulgar. You know how people can get with xbox live like shit talking and flipping out, especially after getting the cold let down like this... I  calmly reply with with only a semi shitty tone in my voice ""Well Thanks for wasting my time having me driving over here, waiting almost an hour, and then getting rejected without even meeting. You really know how to make a guy feel useless.....You're the worst kind of person"". 
 She flies off the fucking handle....and when I say handle, I mean her handle on basic rights and wrong. The barrage of insults was bad enough, but I can shrug those off and move on with my life. She threatens to post my pick on CL. I tell her that won't be necessary and I hang up. A little panicked admittedly...but rightfully so. She makes good on the threat and posts something shitty with my pic. But wait, there's more.  I did NOT realize that my gmail account actually had my first and last name tied to it. Rookie mistake but she used it. 
 She posts an ad with my full frontal nude (face too) pic on craigslist, WITH FIRST AND LAST NAME, annnd a title to the effect of ""Beware of this PSYCHOPATH"".   She proceeds to write every last horrible worst case scenario lie she could must up. ""Faggot, likes to get fucked in the ass, has herpes, aggressive creepy, psychopath, dangerous beware"".... etc etc. And not short and to the point like that, she did a solid paragraph going on and on and on....and there I am, full name disclosed full nude mirror pic dong hanging attempting to be sexy but I'm really just a dork awkward smile on my face"" 
 Holy fucking hell. I'm calling my friends to flag it down. I'm calling local law enforcement to se what can be done.....which isn't dick. She didn't steal the pictures from my phone, I sent them to her, and her choice to post them is not so much their concern. This is before the recent laws against cyber bullying / exposing personal info / fake profiles / revenge porn.  Even now the laws out there aren't perfect and differ state to state.  I had no leverage on her. It was posted the night before, and sat overnight on CL. I sleep on it and have terrible dreams..... 
 The next morning I call her and beg for her to be reasonable. I tell her I have a job, a kid, and plenty of other legitimate responsibilities that need my attention. and this insanity needs no part in my life. I tell her it isn't fair at all, I never did anything malicious to hurt her other than react somewhat condescending to her after she blew me off, and that this is all just fucking lunacy. It took about an of driving that point home and talking about my relatively normal no psychopathic life for her to come around. She finally agrees to take it down and apologizes. I literally thought I was dreaming. She did a complete 360. Normal to pyscho and back to normal all in a 12 hour time span. We agree to let it be an not contact each other again. 
 Fucking stressful. Serious, be careful with how you interact with strangers seeking sex. You'll never think something nuts will happen to you, until it does. And when it does, it happens FAST.

"And don't worry man, I never take offense. You aren't talking down to me, telling me that I'm killing myself and ruining my life, while you are most likely high/do opiates. That's when I get offended, in my eyes, if you do a gram in one day, or stretch it out for 1 week, I look at you the same. It's equal in my book. But I gues you could say I'm an addicted heroin head with morals, as stupid as it sounds. I don't steal. I don't rip people off. I don't lie to get a fix. I don't do any of that. And also, I know I'm going to get a lot of shit when I mention it, but I have a son, that lives with me and so does his mother, and I can proudly say that my son has never witnessed, been around or even known about anything. He is 3 so he picks up a lot of information that sticks with him. I've never taken him on a run to cop, even if I am withdrawing and that's the only way I could I would wait for my girlfriend to get home and keep an eye on him. My son has never went without food, shelter, water, or clothes and diapers ( and them motherfuckers are EXPENSIVE for a 19 year old ) for me to pick up some dope. I don't do dope around him, whenever he is in the house, I will either wait, till I can step away out of the house, or when he is napping. He has never seen any rigs, spoons, cottons, fuck, he's never even seen a cap to a rig. My rent is paid for, food, car insurance, car note ( me and my girlfriend share a 2010 cobalt so it's a hefty car note), electric, gas, water, sewage and trash, Internet, cell phone, daycare, I mean I can go on all day. All of these things are taken care of, and are paid up to date and even a few bills are paid in advance before I even consider picking up any dope. Maintaining my household, and keeping food on the table and my family together and happy comes first before anything, even if it means ill be kicking for the next week while working, by any means I will do what a mans gotta do. I began using heroin a little before my son was born (he was born when I was 15, he is almost 4 now), and really started using after my mom kicked me out after my son was born. Me and my sons mother were both kicked out of our parents houses when my son was born, and I feel like we hav accomplished so much for the hand we were dealt, and for being 19 and my girlfriend being 1 year older then me. To be honest, and not toot my own horn, but how many 19 year olds do you know with a 4 year old that they take care of, still have a loving relationship with the mother, and take care of a household after being pretty much abandoned when it comes to help. Our families even went so far as to not watch him when we would have job interviews right after we got kicked out.  And I can proudly say that I have never recieved ANY form of government assistance, not even insurance. Never had WIC, foodstamps, disabilities, unemployment, workman's comp, section 8, daycare vouchers, ANYTHING. And god damn did it make me a man today. My girlfriend is not a heroin user, or any drug user really, she smokes some bud here and there, she's prescribed adderall, and that's it. I use dope as a rewards system to myself, a little treat if you will, just like my girlfriend does out of her paycheck. And we both pitch in and get my son something he wants every payday if we can afford it. I do it because its priceless seeing him that happy, that and the fact that I feel bad because he rarely sees me and his mother together for more than an hour during the weekdays, because of our schedules. She works 8 am-5 pm M-F and I mainly work nights working in the food industry, so I usually work 6pm- 2:30am 6 days a week, I don't have a set schedule so that sucks, on top of that, she goes to school full time from 6-10 Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. My point of telling you all of this, is because i didn't want you to get the wrong impression of me, not that it would matter it's the god damn Internet, but nonetheless I like telling people our story and I like being proud to have made it this far, even though its REALLY not that far.

"Been needing to write this down so I don't explode. 
 You are the worst person I have the displeasure of knowing. There is no one I have ever met who disgusts and infuriates me as much as you do. You are a horrible person and I am ashamed to be your daughter. 
 Most people are a fair degree of selfish, but I mean you really take the whole fucking cake for yourself. You have zero concern for anyone other than yourself in every situation. The whooooole fucking world revolves around you and your plans and your interests and blah blah blah. You act like you're so god damn smart and you are never wrong and can do no wrong, but the fact that you can't even manage to look behind you to see if you're in someone's way (a think that pisses you off greatly) during the evening rush to the train, just makes you a hypocrite and an idiot. 
 You are completely useless, helpless, dependent, and ungrateful. Let's not forget misogynistic. The first thing you say when you get home is ""what's for dinner?"" not even a greeting to your wife. And of course whatever she's cooking—hamburgers, for instance—is whatever you bought for lunch today and is totally unacceptable. Like mom is supposed to know what you had for lunch when you were at work and she was at work, too busy to read your fucking mind. You should be glad she comes home and cooks after work at all. You'd be dead from a heart attack (shocking it hasn't happened already) from eating TV dinners every night if it wasn't for her. You're so fucking helpless, you couldn't find an elephant behind a postage stamp. 
 You are seriously the biggest asshole I've ever met. Possibly an even bigger asshole than your son, but at least he has  some  manners. Since everyone's life revolves around you and your plans, it is  completely  unreasonable for someone else to have made plans independent of you that require you to change your plans a teeny bit. You see, if you don't tell anyone what the fuck your plan actually is, you can't expect them to coordinate with you if necessary. And guess what, everyone who is not you does not plan out what they're doing every second of every day. Quit fucking asking me if I have plans for the weekend every day, I don't know! I might not have plans for Saturday at 7 until Saturday at 6! Everyone is not a neurotic nutcase like you! And jesus fucking christ learn some manners. Grandma is nuts, but she had to have at least taught you not to talk with your mouth full. Or to thank people for doing things for you. Or to clean up after yourself. Or to help other people out. Or to just not be a dick 24/7. 
 Also, you're a terrible fucking liar. I don't know if mom knows where you're going these random weekend days, but I'm pretty sure I know now. It could be worse, but the fact that you're lying about it still makes it bad. You come up with the stupidest shit, too. Oh you're going to a ""music event"" but you don't know what it's called, it's at a random bar in the neighboring state, and it starts at 10am? Sounds legit. Sounds like a load of shit you just pulled out of your ass. You had two days to come up with a good story since someone else asked you. Seriously, mom might be oblivious, but I'm not an idiot and I will hang it over your head if I have to. 
 Really you are a piece of shit. You're an asshole, you're selfish, you're an idiot, you're an alcoholic, you're a liar, you're rude, you're fake, you're a racist, and you are certifiably psychotic. You have anger management issues, you have no concern for other people, you think the world exists for you, you freak out about every little thing that might put a grain of rice in your plans (oh my god there are ten people in line to turn left, we're going to be stuck here forever, i'm never driving this way again), you pretend like every one of your ideas is golden, you waste money on shit you don't need like your retarded fucking hobby that you don't even spend a lot of time on (and then of course complain about money), and you can't be bothered to learn newer or more efficient ways of doing anything so you constantly fuck yourself into situations that enrage everyone.

"As a veteran RA, I'd like to correct this. The vast majority of RAs are people who genuinely like their jobs and just want to make college as awesome as possible for their residents. Every single RA HATES having to bust drunk idiots late at night. 
 Is the system flawed? Yes. Can we make it easier on each other? Yes. Yes, my friends, we can. 
 Here's what you should keep in mind: Any punishment you receive following any interaction with any RA is based on what that RA thinks of you. And oh you bet your bottom dollar we have blacklists. You be a drunk ass and that's what goes into the report. And it's the reports that the RDs and OHRL central staff and sometimes the Dean read. 
 We know the party rooms. We know what rooms we have to be hardasses to. Please do not become one of those rooms. The best advice I can give is to cooperate as much as possible. Here's how: 
 1.) Open the door. Seriously. Open the door now. Please. You wait longer than 15 seconds and any RA will know something's up. They'll look and each other and mouth ""Please open the door. Please please just open the fucking door,"" and they'll put on their mean RA faces and get ready to crack down on drunk idiots. 
 What you should do is make a general rule of not having handles of cheap vodka all over the place. Make yourself a drink and put the bottles back in the fridge/on the shelf/under your bed/where ever. (Note: this is just a good rule in life. Put things back where they belong). If/when RAs knock because it's too loud, you can just open the door, and by doing so quickly, almost any RA will not even bother to look inside the room. Even if they suspect you of drinking. Really. Just open the door. It's that simple. Why? Because you're not being obvious and you're making their job easier. They remind you of quiet hours, you turn the music down, you all say goodnight, and that's that. 30 seconds out of everyone's night. 
 Or the RAs knock, you scramble to the door and then say to the rest of the room ""Shit! It's the RAs!"" (which we totally can't hear on the other side of those sound proof dorm doors), and then you shoo the 20 or so people in the common room into the bedrooms, clink all the bottles around in the process of hiding them, and then answer the door after the RAs have been knocking and hearing all of what's been going on inside the room. Then they have to come in. And they'll have to wait for everyone to come out of the rooms with lame excuses like "" yawn  oh we were just sleeping."" Yes, of course. You were just sleeping. With the lights on. Fully dressed. With your shoes on. Standing up. Sounds legit. And then we go through the shpiel of collecting IDs and taking notes and possibly calling Public Safety, which only ever makes things worse (They don't know RA protocol so they usually screw us up, and they come down about 387 times harder on you than your RAs will). And then your lovely RAs have to spend another good hour and a half after they leave your room writing up a report and tracking down all of your personal files. So that's maybe 30 min to an hour of your time and about 3 hours of your RAs time. 
 If you cooperate, if you open the door quickly, if, in the event that the RAs come in and ask you if you've been drinking, you do not lie, you bring the alcohol, and you do not pick a fight, those RAs will go out of their way to make sure nothing happens to you. If you make their night hell, they will go out of their way to make sure every other RA in the building knows you're an ass who needs to learn some manners. 
 Good ideas:
1.) Don't party in the LB. Go off campus. Or, if you must, hang out in the bedrooms of PRow and Colonial suites. 
 2.) Go smoke outside. Seriously, the Common and gardens are right there. RIGHT THERE! And they're LOVELY! 
 3.) RAs are people, too. People who like to have fun and go to parties and throw events using OHRL's money. People like you who just need to pay for college and working for free housing is the only way to do that. 
 4.) Befriend your RAs. They are some of the greatest people Emerson has to offer. Plus, it means you won't get in trouble nearly as much.

"This is such a clusterfuck of a story and I'm in need of an explanation that maybe you guys can provide. I'll do my best to just list the facts and events chronologically here. Apologies in advance if this get's too ridiculous to help me solve. 
 
 I'm 25f, he's 32m.  
 We met in 2009 at a music festival, and I gave him a ride back home (4 hours on the road at midnight... cool way to chat and get to know someone, not instant love, just thought he was a really cool dude) 
 He lives in a city 2.5 hours away from mine, but I hate my city and I visit his city as often as possible with the intention of moving there soon because all my friends are there. 
 Didn't really see or speak to each other between 2009 and fall of 2012. 
 Suddenly we're having AWESOME chats on facebook, his brain turns me on, apparently my brain tickles his fancy as well. 
 Kept making lazy, half-baked efforts to meet for coffee sometime (he's in a band, I'm a full-time grad student) 
 Finally was able to reunite at his birthday party in his city, hit it off, he insisted on taking me out for breakfast the next day. 
 Breakfast happened, good and natural, comfortable vibes 
 Several days can pass between texts and phone calls, but whenever we do get on the phone, we can talk for hours 
 His band came to my town and he told me he liked me. Came back with me. Sex. I have a weird anxiety/emotional attack afterwards because I was scared of the relationship zone. He was wonderful and understood fully. I was CERTAIN he wasn't going to call me after that shitshow meltdown, but he did. 
 Called and asked when I'd come back to his city, invited me to stay at his place... then I was like ""fuck... I really like him. I DO want him"" 
 Stayed at his place for a weekend, had epic sex, he cooked me breakfast, was openly affectionate in front of his roommates, but started kind of shutting down as I started opening up (WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME) 
 I go back home. Weeks pass. He falls into a weird depression and doesn't talk to anybody. He's going through some shit, being broke, unemployed, etc... I get it. I don't pester him one bit, but I am concerned, at least as a friend would be. 
 He called me at odd hours (3am, 10am) and left adorable messages to call him back, I would, but then he wouldn't answer either.  
 Finally, in April, I was in town again. We go out for coffee, we talk about how durrr we both are in this area, and he says:
""I really like our friendship, and I want to hang out with you this summer. I'm also very sexually attracted to you. But you can't expect a relationship out of me.""
I told him ""sex and friendship are a perfect deal right now! I don't want a heavy relationship either, but we have to at least stay on the same page and talk every now and then to make sure we are..."" he mentioned he preferred to be exclusive, that he's not sleeping with anyone but me and doesn't want/care/intend to... and then we went back and had AMAZING sex and then I went home. 
 
 Now, I'm in his city (within 10 miles of him) for the entire summer. I've seen him twice at shows he's performed in where he seemed happy to see me, and I've been here almost a month, but we still haven't arranged to hang out or have more sex. I texted him after much time asking if he wanted to go hiking or biking sometime, to which he said yes, but it's been a couple weeks and we still haven't made real arrangements. I don't want to press my luck too much because I know he's a busy and struggling dude, and I REALLY don't want to annoy him, or worse... find out he's not actually into me? But that's what I'm wondering. Now here are my questions/concerns: 
 I in fact, REALLY like him. He's an incredible man and would be worth the wait, but I genuinely can't tell if I'm waiting in vain, because if he really liked me, wouldn't he have wanted to see me and try to make that happen after almost a month in? 
 I know we were both retarded about relationships and being attracted to each other mutually and exclusively, but... is there hope anyway? Should I move on? I don't want to move on. I'm on his hook until I have hard evidence that he's seeing someone else, but so far it seems that is not the case!!! He tends to voluntarily tell me so! Help. Thank you.",4257,"ridiculously complicated events that led to what seems like an exclusive FWB situation.

"Fuck my roommate. 
 We met on craigslist. You came off as ""dorky"" and ""eccentric"", but the condo you and your parents bought matched my requirements. I rationalized in my head that's it's okay you can't really handle people and having a quiet place would be a good break from a busy and demanding lifestyle. My friends and family warned that she may not be a good fit, but I tried to be positive about the whole thing. 
 When I moved in I should of recognized the red flags. You refused to talk to me when our families first met and hid behind your mother. Your mother in turn was a helicopter parent and a mean ""mama bear"" type. She was very confrontation with me and constantly made me justify why I am moving in here and acted like I was some kind of scumbag. 
 And then when our time together began, it became obvious this wasn't going to end well. You never left your room and it has been a year and I've never seen you outside of the condo. I used to worry about you and invite you out to places, but you always shot me down and I stopped. You're in your mid twenties and your room is decorated in Pokemon and World of Warcraft toys. While I respect your own space, you like to comment and criticize me on my time spent around the condo. You say things like how I couldn't be done doing the dishes because I didn't spend enough time in the kitchen. I now know what you do in your room is micro-manage me. 
 You creep people out. I can't have guests over anymore. They are disturbed that you spend all your time in your room and haven't met you once. I used to defend you, but you started nitpicking about things that were out of place from when my guests were over, and left condescending post-it notes for me to find the next day. 
 You refused to have quick conversations about getting the kinks out of our time together. You instead complained to your mother, the landlord, about me. I don't know what these e-mails said and I frankly don't get a fuck, but I in turn got multi-paragraph long e-mails from ""mama bear"" about how much of a piece of shit I am and do not qualify to be a human being. Your mom is then confused why I don't make an effort to see her when she is down. When I do talk to her, I can tell she is surprised that I am a nice and respectful young man, contrary to what the e-mails must say. 
 You're not nice. I can't even say hi, good morning, or good night to you without a deathstare. Even when I am gone for a long period of time and want to say Hi when I return, you are quick to slam your door shut and remind me that I am not welcomed. You can't handle small talk and act really weird in conversations. I've done nothing to warrant this abusive neglect, but I know it's not just me getting it because you have no friends and shut the world out. Whenever we do talk it comes down to you scowling me about something so you can't be surprised that I am not excited to have a conversation with you. You blame me for things that are equally our fault. You think I am the reason the internet wifi goes down once a month and I must be doing ""weird shit"" on the internet and am some kind of deviant or hacker. Well there are multiple computers on the network and it happens. Of course when one of us leaves for the weekend the internet will run more smoothly. You have to stop telling how great the internet is when I am gone for a weekend and it's all my fault. You also leave post it notes about shit like getting the bathroom mat wet after a shower. I did not know our bathroom mats in the condo were decorative. 
 I can't watch TV or cook anything in the kitchen without getting passive aggressive nitpicking notes from you. It has forced me to spend my entire time in my room when I am home and makes me feel hated and isolated. I do not need this after spending my days working full time and going to class at night. 
 Your negligence has been emotionally abusive to me. I can't wait to leave and dread the next person who lives with you. 
 You have hurt me so much. I refuse to complain to family and friends about this because I am not pity and I wouldn't want you to do the same to me. I already know this type of respect isn't a two way street. This is why I'm doing an anonymous internet post about it. 
 Fuck you.

"Mine is another online site story.  PoF to be exact. 
 Came across a girl, she looked pretty cute.  We had a lot of similar interests.  Turned out she lived in the same apartment complex as I did.  When I finally went to meet her BAM, I was tricked by the fat girl angle.  Now, she wasn't just fat, she was HUGE.  Like...300+ lbs huge.  I'm not a douche though, so I figured I'd give her the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she could turn into a pretty cool friend. 
 Wrong.  I go into her apartment and the first thing I see is some guy with a mullet giving some other overweight girl a back massage, who happened to be topless with a bunch of dicks drawn on her back.  To make matters worse they didn't have any furniture in their apartment other than a filthy mattress on the floor.  There's bottles of jack laying on the floor, a bong that's laying on the floor, leaking bong water everywhere.  Place smells like someone took a dump right in the center of their living room.  There were about 5 cats eating out of the random trash bags strewn across their living room floor. 
 Then I start hearing moaning coming from the bedroom.  She said one of her roommates was a slut and shes probably fucking a guy for some free meth.  I figured she was fucking around, nope.  Turns out the other two people I saw when I first came into the apartment were strung out on heroin. 
 I've never felt more out of place in my life.  She then decides to unleash the mother of all fucks onto me.  She asks me how I feel about the lesbian, gay, bi, and transvestite community.  I told her it doesn't bother me.  She asked if I'd be bothered at the fact that she had a penis.  Well at this point I figured she was just fucking with me.  I begrudgingly call her on her bluff, trying to make light of an awkward situation, but at the same time not really gauging how bad it really was.  That's when she pulled her pants down, and sure as shit, she had what looked to be the smallest god damn cock I've ever seen in my entire life. Before that day I always thought the idea of someone having a ""baby dick"" was just an exaggeration. Nope. There it was, staring me in the eye. 
 Before I had a chance to say or do anything, she explains to me that she considers herself and her friends to be hedonists.  She said they have wild LBGT orgies at her apartment almost every Friday.  She said her PoF profile is simply used to pick up ""new fish"" for them to try and convert so they can drug them out and fuck them during their parties.  She must've thought I was down for more than smoking a bowl, which was my original reason for going by there. 
 Needless to say I was a little paranoid to just randomly peace the fuck out.  I've already seen the shit that goes on here, what if they're afraid I'll go to the cops if I panic and/or act nervous?  So I texted a buddy of mine and told him to call me ASAP and pretend that there is some sort of situation going on where he needs me right away.  A few minutes later he gives me a call and just starts screaming random shit over the phone, just loud enough for the few people in the apartment to hear it through my phone and assume something was wrong.  I told them my roommate got into a serious car crash and I had to rush off the hospital.  I left her apartment hoping we would never cross paths again. 
 Things only managed to get worse. She knew I lived in the same complex as she did.  She must've started stalking me or something because a week or so later she starts knocking on my door. Asked me if I was still down for one of her ""parties"".  Even after I told her I wasn't interested she still came back every week for the next month or so.  Once I stopped answering the door she started blowing up my phone.  She some how got my FB info and started sending me creepy messages before I blocked her. 
 Thankfully it didn't last much longer.  I assume their whole drug induced orgy got busted by the cops one day.  I was just told that an apartment on her floor got busted by the cops one night when they came to investigate for a noise problem. 
 I don't think I've ever been in a more awkward situation in my entire life. People can say they have had great luck with online dating sites.  As for me? I'm never even going to contemplate using them ever again.",4290,"Met up with girl that lives in my apartment complex from PoF.

"Honestly, I have no fucking clue. I can’t even tell you what position he plays. He has an enormous head and the offensive skillset of wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man. I flipped my shit when the Magic took him over Dante Exum. I mean, what could the Magic possibly want with a tweener forward who shot 42% FROM THE LINE in college. But halfway into his second season I’m once again eating my words and thanking Rob Hennigan for giving me a reason to watch the Magic brick 50 shots a night. For those less masochistic souls, this post is an attempt to let the kid’s game speak for itself, in all of its awkward glory. 
 “I have no idea what position Gordon plays, and that is awesome.” – Zach Lowe 
 DEFENSE 
 Gordon has been dad-dicking dudes  and the fastest shuttle run in a combine that featured Zach Lavine and Dante Exum, the kid’s elite athleticism makes him one of the very few non-hyperbolic threats to guard 1-5 on any given night ([sorry for video]( Furthermore, he’s often tasked with taking on the opposing team’s best players. Think about that for a second. How many young prospects with less than 82 NBA games played do you think a coach like SCOTT FUCKING SKILES would trust to guard [Lebron James]( [Kevin Durant]( [Paul George]( Harden]( and [Demarcus Cousins](  Skiles doesn’t even trust Mario Hezonja to tie his own shoes. Sure Gordon gets overzealous and launches himself past a shooter every once in a while, bites on a fake here and there, but the kids got some solid instincts and discipline with a ridiculous [motor]( Aaron has stated his goal is to win DPOY and regardless of whether or not he can achieve that goal, the evidence of his mindset shows up in abundance. He may never have the offense prowess of the some of the wings taken before him in the draft, but I think Gordon would prefer it [this way]( 
 SCORING 
 It’s not hard to see where the Griffin comparisons came from when he was doing  this kind of thing in college ,  fallaways , although there is just something about the way he [sets his feet that bothers me]( Combine all these moves and it gives Aaron a chance to really show off his stupid [athleticism]( 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 Due to Aaron’s  awkwardly agile attack style , a bit of a dubious brag considering the team’s reputation for being really soft around the rim (shoutout to Vuc and Dipo). Luckily, the shot doctor has turned Gordon’s pitiful college 42% free throw rate into 70% in the NBA. And thank God for that because his absolutely fearlessness to the point of recklessness hasn’t gone [unnoticed]( His handles are [good]( but not great and he’s got nice court vision to go along solid passing, occasionally with [flair]( Throw this together with a ridiculous 14.3 rebounding rate, a would be league best for small forwards, and you start to get an idea of Gordon’s ethic. Before you argue that it’s misleading because he’s a power forward I give you basketball reference’s [estimates]( to cast some doubt on that. Besides, is it really important to figure out which of Tobias Harris and Aaron Gordon is the Small and which is the Power? Exactly. Gordon is just weird. 
 As far as Gordon’s outlook is concerned, it’s worth note that he’s a fucking baby. He’s like 17th youngest in the league young. That makes him a month older than KAT and younger than Porzingod. The kid closest to him in age has a face that looks like [this]( So it’s safe to say this kid with a budding case of the [Dwight Howard shoulders]( has some room to grow. I have no idea what his ceiling is, nor do I even want to venture to guess. In the end, Gordon is a player without an easy comparison, and is I think an interesting example of a trend of positionless basketball in the NBA, specifically where lateral and vertical athleticism create matchup problems rather than length. I don’t know what position he plays, and frankly I think it’s close to time we stop trying to fit players into some of those rigid traditional roles. I’m just sitting here trying to appreciate the weirdness to his game.

"I realize you're probably not looking for advice, but this is the internet. So I'm going to give it to you anyway. 
 Let's begin with my credentials: I am a male, and a masturbator of 13 years; more than half my life now. During a more flexible period of my life, while fully erect I could put the head of my penis into my own mouth.  Regrettably I was not nearly experienced enough at the time to enjoy it. 
 Here's a bit of masturbating theory:
The best orgasms are reached by imitating an ideal vagina.  So lets think about it.  What are vaginas like?  Warm.  Wet--but not like watery wetness--water tends to wash away oils that make it nice and slippery.  Kind of tight, but evenly so, and not like a strangle hold.   Textured  bumpy as shit. 
 And here's a list of factors that might affect your orgasm 
 General wellbeing 
 Diet  What have you eaten today?  Do you have to shit?  Do you constantly have to shit?  Are you feeling bloated?  Masturbating and then immediately taking a shit is not nearly as glorious as it sounds. 
 Exercise   Fapping is a full body experience.  The hormones secreted don't affect only your penis, so take cues from the rest of your body as well.  Even if it's just, ""My arm is getting sore and my legs have fallen asleep.""  Personally I admit that I'm into really athletic orgasms.  When I am about to come, I flex everything I possibly can.  Lately I've taken to masturbating while standing up and I come on point like a god damn ballerina.  The most awesome sex I have ever had involved arching my back into a full body bridge supporting my partner completely off the mattress. 
 Sleep   It is possible to be too tired to masturbate.  One time, I fell asleep with my dick in my hand. 
 Physical Conditions 
 Temperature  This should be fairly self explanetory, so I'll be brief.  Not because I don't think you need to be informed on the topic, but because I don't have any awesome stories to share. 
 Texture  Pay attention to what works for you.  How can you change the texture of your hand?  I have tried all kinds of shit; latex and rubber gloves, silk, cotton,  rags, socks, cardboard, my hand after having sanded it with 600 grit paper. Anyway, skin seems to work best for me. 
 Humidity  Yes. Humidity, even more than temperature affects how much you sweat.  It doesn't take a lot to make your palms or shaft sweat, and when you start to sweat, you change the coefficient of friction.  You change the sliding factor.  Your skin starts to stick to your skin and it just isn't pleasurable. 
 Lube   Water isn't the greatest lube. Oils and oil based products work well, but are often expensive and look very conspicuous in the bathroom.  Other shower products like body soap or conditioner also work, but beware of getting them in your dick slit.   You thought getting shampoo in your eyes was bad? That's cute. 
 No discussion on Masturbation can be complete without a note on stimulation;  It is important to devote a certain amount of time and energy to figuring out where your greatest concentration of nerve endings are.  Once I figured out that I had an enormous quantity on the top of my penis, just behind the head, I rubbed that spot exclusively and came very quickly.  But they weren't the highest quality orgasms, and I found myself bored, and masturbating as a chore.  So devote a bit more thought.  There are nerves at the base of your penis that would only get stimulated if you were up to your balls.  And in fact, a light sliding touch across the entire length to simulate deep thrusting is the most time consuming and arousing thing I have discovered I can do to myself. 
 Consider also when was the last time you had sex or masturbated.  From an evolutionary standpoint, the best thing you can do, second only to eating (and even that is debatable) is to empty your testicles.  But first, you need them to be full.  Average men take about 4 days to reach maximum sperm capacity, and we don't shoot all in one load.  If cave men are to impregnate many women, we cant afford that.  But if you're having sex three or four times a week, you may never reach maximum capacity. 
 My advice is this:  Prepare.   Take a few days to sleep well.  Eat food high in fiber to clear your colon.  Exercise enough to be energetic when the time comes, but not so much that you're sore and stiff.",4337,"I know way too much about my own body.

"Man, where to start?
I literally can't remember when it all started. About 3 years ago I think. Got TOLD on the phone by social services I was going to be arrested the next day. What I got from them and the police and my ex at the time was that my ex's 3 yr old daughter said something about me, a tree and magic water, and pointed to her bum. What my ex's baby dad got from that was 'oh, he's a paedophile and has clearly done something unspeakable to my daughter'. What a cunt. Instead of talking to anyone, he rang the police straight away and told them his warped view. 
 So I bought 2 litres of vodka+orange juice at 8am, drank as much of it as I could as quickly as I could and got fucked off my face. Remember the police woman being a complete dick, stayed in the cell for about 8 hours I guess crying and sobering up, made my statement and got dropped home about 12 hours later. The driver asked 'are you ok?' I said not really. He said to my parents 'he's a bit fragile, look after him'. My bail conditions were to not have any contact with any minors (under 16 year olds for a week.) Thankfully, that was the extent of my interaction with the authorities. 
 So that night I stayed with my ex. Things were obviously weird for a while, but she had absolutely no reason to doubt me and we thought we would get over it and had a great time verbally destroying her babydad. And I was fucking brilliant with her daughter too, played with her all the time, made her laugh, included her in absolutely everything. 
 Then she told her 'best friend'. Who told everyone else.
So now all my exes friends think I'm a paedo. 
 My ex convinced me that it would all be ok, that we could still be together. Me, thinking otherwise, still gave her the benefit of the doubt and tried to make it work. Clearly with something like that over our heads, things went sour.
Drunk arguments ensued at her house, with her ultimately screaming, among other things: 'you're a paedophile, you've touched up my daughter', so I hit her, headbutted her, walked out that night. 
 Cue prescribed sleeping pills (that me as a 22 year old was not allowed to handle myself, given to my parents!), cutting, beta blockers, citalopram, mirtazapine. Quitting University second year (Astrophysics+Scientific Computing, yeah I know, that pissed me off the most.), drinking 8 cans of Strongbow every night. No job. And not going out with my friends to any of my locals for fear of seeing anyone from her friend circle. For 2 years. 
 What hardened me most were 2 incidents on nights out with my friends (who are supportive as fuck) at the same venue, about a month after I was arrested. 
1: ex was there, we hugged and chatted a bit, then got on with our nights separately. Girl I vaguely recognised asked my name, took my glasses, screwed them up and punched me at least 3 times in the face.
2: Outside in the smoking area (same venue) I got a tap on my shoulder from behind me, turned right into a punch full in the face. Luckily for him, he was a pussy and ran down the road before I could react. 
 Both incidents I made a full statement the next day, as I knew exactly who it was (1 ex's best friends sister and 2 ex's best friends sisters best friend). But police had no CCTV. Later confirmed who it was as they both blocked be from facebook (LOL). So if I ever see him again, yeah. 
 After that, I smoked like a trooper for about a year (not at all now, as I believe smoking is a mental addiction, although every now and then I have one when I'm drunk to calm me.) 
 I haven't seen her friends for over a year, which is great. My new years resolution was to never cut myself again. I can't remember the last time I cried. I hear my ex is now telling people I molested her daughter and beat her, but I don't care. Even her boyfriends best friend doesn't believe her and doesn't agree with him being with her. I see her sometimes with her new bf. And I truly laugh and feel sorry for him. I go to all my locals now. I am confident as fuck. I do NOT believe in fate. I have a massive indifference to any personal experiences that are out of my control in that instance. You will be hard pushed to find me in a serious mood now. Shit happens and you deal with it. Everyone should read Nassim Nicholas Taleb's books, especially Black Swan Theory.

"ok, i'm not gonna translate that bullshit that little scumbag said, because it's mainly bullshit. 
 the key element is this: 
 little fuckshits like that did not for once try to beat him up because he is white/german. it's all about a powercircle. that little shithead was trying to provoke him into trouble. 
 see, i'm a german. but i look like a middle eastern. mainly because my parents came from iran and i lived the past 28 years in germany. i for one grew up with values and with mainly a german friendbase. we had different type of nationalities in our group. race never was the issue. reflecting on it now it was all about manners. 
 when growing up i had to take beatings nad insults from both sides. 
 germans often bullied me because i wasn't white. immigrant groupings like these bullied me because i hung out whit whites. 
 no place to go for me. but picking a fight with either side would always end up in a huuuuuuge pile of crap (read: more beating) 
 the scene in the video doesn't happen on civilized grounds as i like to call it. it's in a ghetto. to understand this one needs to know that in germany even a ghetto looks like every other part of a city. it's not like in the states where you can easily distinguish by looks. you can only tell them apart by the majority of etnics living there. this is a very heavily turkish/arabic part i suppose. (the footage is too shitty to point out for sure where this took place but if i had to guess cologne or the area around it) 
 while i would say this shit isn't funny, it happens on both sides of the colorspectrum. it just so happens to find more attention when it's the immigrants who are the bullies. 
 imagine for a moment you are white and think ""hey i'll just take a stroll thru south compton"" that may not end well. 
 mh, i feel like i'm getting sidetracked here, but all i can say about the footage is, it's not about his race. he was chosen becasue he is easy to bully on. i tell you why. remember me telling you about myself being bullied? well that only happened when i was alone. never when i was in group... never? well yes, it happened once. 
 when i was 19 i was at a club with my gf at that time and a couple of buddies. all white. me the only black-haired with a blond gf. and some other guys didn't appreciate the cultural mix and one ""accidentally tossed"" his beer on me saying something like ""scheiss kanacke"" which is the equivalent of ""fucking nigger"" for you US based readers. before i could react, some of my buddies were allready beating the shit out of him and after security threw us all out, the scene went on on the parking lot. no beatings. what you have to understand about germans is this: they have a very big mouth. but when put to the test, they flinch. like the other white boy in the video defending him verbally, but not stepping in for his buddy. a famaous german quote in such a situation is ""i'm not gonna get involved"" they backed up because i had a group of people behind me. just like the little fucker has. you can't win once a party has established they step in if need. if that little fucker got a beating in front of his friends by the white boy all hell would break lose. they would gather their bigger brothers and relatives and anyone who is within short reach and stalk the kid down till they get him. losing face is bad for those who thinnk they have nothing else. it's a dilemma with an endless cycle. 
 while i am very well aware that this may sound like bashing germans, it is just halfheartedly so since i consider myself a german too. 
 to conclude this i can only asure you folks the white kid did it right. and for those who expected some justiceporn should think of it this way: 
 that little fucker can't even articulate basic german words. he is illiterate if you so will. karma doesn't have to be instant... on the other hand, he might just be a fuckhead because nobody ever shown him any other way. he is in the wrong but sadly he has no other option than to be someone. 
 i appoligize for my wall of text but it's 5am here in germany and this issue hit close to home (pun?) 
 if it isn't clear what i was trying to say, please let me know i'll explain further as my mind was raging with flashbacks and i'm sure i might have slipped some points i was trying to bring along. but i could easyly write an essay on this matter given the time but i'm too lazy to do it, if there is no need.",4415,white boy said he liked the new star trek movie and get's beaten because it's a trashy remake,93,0.9252676367759703,0.0129522755742073,0.0894628167152404,0.0001320249866694,0.8800815939903259,0.0005615351838059,0.013847823254764,0.0001527578424429,0.6339598894119263,0.0008281852933578,0.3402929008007049,0.0006629023700952,The video shows a white man being beaten up by a group of middle eastern men.

"This is my opinion. You butthurt SJW'S and feminists can shove your misandry and xenophobia right up your huge gaping assholes. You merely adopted the downvotes, I was born into them. 
 I am extremely sick of seeing the terms ""white privilege"" and ""male privilege"". I will explain why I believe that. 
 White privilege does not exist. Every single successfull rich white person I know have worked hard to get where they are, in the high social and financial position they are in. I'm a white man, and guess what? I only make $11 an hour at a shitty gas station. My customers frequently insult me and treat me like shit, and I keep a smile on my face and still tell everyone that leaves to have a good day. Am I privileged? I understand some people can't get jobs. But that's because job hunting is hard work! You can't just live off unemployment and welfare your whole life, and then complain that someone else who works hard everyday has ""white privilege"". As for cops shooting black people, that's not based on their race. It's because the suspect was acting unruly, aggressive, and because they are doing something that makes the cop feel endangered, like maybe reaching for a cop's gun. Every time a white cop shoots a black person, Black Lives Matter gets all up in arms, but you know what's ironic? When a back cop shot another black person, Black Lives Matter was totally silent, not a word by them. And as a bonus, the leaders of Black Lives Matter have called an open season on white people and cops, that is they told their supporters that the mission statement is to kill any white person or cop they can, and post the picture on social media. Oh, but they're so oppressed right? And we as white people are racist, simply because we are white. It has gotten so bad, that I now wish I was born a different race than white. Black Lives Matter has made more than a few white people resent their own race, by massive amounts of guilt-tripping. Why are black people still upset about slavery? That was almost 100 years ago iirc, and as far as I know next to no one alive back then is alive today. Why constantly guilt and punish us for racist actions our ancestors commited? Before you call me racist, just know that I was engaged to a black woman and had discussed having kids until she cheated on me then dumped me. I have nothing wrong with any race, but when a group targets a race and attaches such a vile stigma demonizing them, isn't that kind of racist in itself? Oh yeah, I forgot. You can't be racist towards white people. 
 Male privilege does not exist either. Women can do literally anything a man can do and more, such as birthing children, and going to women only abuse shelters. Women have quite a lot of ""such and such for women"" establishments and groups. I promise you, that if we men had a men's sanctuary for recovering from abuse and rape, women would get upset and throw justifications and arguments at us such as ""men can't be raped"", and ""hitting women is illegal, hitting men is legal"". If you women really stood for equality, you wouldn't actually stand for superiority in reality. Men don't get paid more. For example: I get paid $11 an hour. I have been working here for 4 years now. My two female coworkers (who do literally the exact same job as I do) have been working here for.. maybe a year in total. They are both paid $16 an hour. Jennifer Lawrence made far more in American Hustle than the males did. Wanna talk about being paid less, fuck outta here with that nonsense. Women can vote, join the army, and get less harsh legal punishment than a man would. Men have the highest ratio of work related injuries, work related deaths, and suicides. I have seen many, many times men being verbally attacked and the  only  reason for it, is that they are men. 
 Now remember, this is all  my opinion , and you don't have to agree. But please, for the love of all that is holy, stop saying people have ""privilege"". I'll tell you who has privilege, Hillary Clinton does. She has had emails exposed that are felonies. Is she in jail? Nope. America and the media has exalted her and made light of her criminal emails. Everyone is voting for her, because ooooh first female president. I say hell no, if you're voting for Hillary because she's a female, you are what's wrong with this country these days. Make whatever assumptions you want about me you judgmental feminists and liberals, but I'm voting for Trump.",4443,white privilege and male privilege do not exist.

"Doing another analysis because fuck it, I love Dignitas (I'm not biased I swear) and I got a lot of nice feedback from my last one.  I feel like this is going to be short, but here goes . 
 Team Dignitas v. Fnatic 
 TEAM DIGNITAS 
 Some people might disagree with me, but TD is imo the top team in the world at the moment. Ever since the Ex-Copenhagen Wolves made their return earlier this year re-branded as Team Dignitas (yes, they have had a small roster change since then, but aizy is a crazy-good rifler), these guys have consistently been putting out awesome results. And yes, I've been riding the hype train ever since that debut match in March for Fragbite Masters 2k14 where they won against onlinesportz. Odds were like 30-70 in favor of mousesports and they just took the candy straight out of their wee little baby arms. They may not have won all the tournaments, but no team,  NO TEAM  is safe from the Dignitas hype train. Think about it. Every single matchup nowadays, who's gonna be favored? Dignitas v. NiP, Dignitas v. Titan, Dignitas v. Virtus.pro? Okay, that last one might be 50-50, but my point with all this hype-talk right now is NOBODY IS SAFE. And the best part is that TD is fucking  consistent . Okay, I'm done getting all hyped-up (I'm seriously jittery right now) 
 Now on to some actual analysis. 
 Firstly, I'd like to point out Team Dignitas' record on Dust2, which it seems /u/scrub_ has already done. Not only has TD won the past  six  games of DD2 they've played, they also have a 75% (15-5) win rate for the past  twenty  games they've played. Four of those losses were to Virtus.pro; Two on inferno, one of VP's best maps, and one on season (w/e) and Cache. Only other loss was to NiP. This might be the hype talking but I honestly don't think anyone can beat TD except VP on inferno and the less-played maps, and NiP when they're on point. This is because Team Dignitas has some of the smoothest strategy execution with very little error. This makes it incredibly difficult for any team to beat them except the very top few, right now those being VP and NiP, and maybe Titan. 
 Let's talk DD2 strats. 
 On team Dignitas we have: 
 
 5 very strong riflers 
 
 I think 3(?) career AWPers (It might be 2 now since cajunb left, I know FeTiSh and de_vice are both quite strong awpers) 
 
 One of the most experienced and best IGLs in the world, FeTiSh. 
 
 
 After their return at Gfinity we saw some awesome strats that FeTiSh must have whipped up in his down-time. However, there really aren't many new plays that can be made in DD2, except some super complex meta shit. Anyways, my main point in this part is that TD is super-versatile, and extremely solid in their strategies. They can run double, maybe even triple AWP setups on CT side and smash face. Few mistakes are ever made. 
 Okay, Dig, you had your turn. How about Fnatic now? 
 FNATIC 
 So we saw a semi-impressive performance from Fnatic in G3. Taking a game against an arguably ""slumped"" NiP, but a win against NiP nonetheless. Nothing to scoff at. What I'm thinking is, if they barely beat (16-14) a mediocre NiP; a team that has to be on-point to take down Dignitas, how can they expect to defeat Dig on one of their (Fnatic's) worst maps? That's right, in Gfinity 3, Fnatic went 1-2-1 on dust2, losing to mousesports and Titan, both of which are teams who have had somewhat recent roster changes and are still struggling a tiny bit to get consistent results. That said, Fnatic's recent results are nothing to just brush aside. Prior to G3 they took on teams such as Na'Vi and had decent results. However, Fnatic is not by any means consistent with their wins. They lost to LDLC in a Bo3 last month and barely beat mousesports in a Bo3. Then they went late into G3 and lost a Bo3 to Titan. Fnatic, while being a team full of very talented players, simply cannot get consistent and convincing results against top-tier teams, much less TD, who right now seem to be in a league of their own. 
 I'm not even going to talk DD2 strats for Fnatic because I feel like there isn't anything incredibly special about their team for the map other than the fact that olofm and JW can run double-AWP setup. I think the elephant in the room is Fnatic's DD2 record. It's terrible. barely any wins except against lower tier teams, and a couple wins here and there, notably two wins against NiP, but other than that it's smash after smash after smash. 
 =============== 
 Okay , so here's the",4476,"Dignitas strong like bear, fight hard win easy. Dust2 good map for them. Fnatic weak like little baby, small arms, no reach, cry in T spawn. Dignitas little alien man abduct this baby. Take into space ship, probe until cry. Many skins to be won on little alien man. 
 Fnatic is weak on dust2 and has poor results. Dignitas is a very solid team with awesome execution and can out-aim and out-play just about anyone. Dignitas is also on a huge streak on D2, one of their best maps, smacking down each and every team that challenges them on it. 
 Risk of upset:  Low. 
 CSGL Odds right now:  70-30 
 My Odds:  75-25 
 Betting on Dignitas:  Predicting it to go | Dignitas 16 | 9 Fnatic | 
 My Bet:  Okay, [here]( it is. Posted my bet on Titan v. VP as well so that you guys can see I am going small-medium on them. I feel like Titan is just much more consistent right now than VP. I am NOT betting on HR v Na'Vi. Too risky on either side. 
 Should probably add that you should NEVER go all-in. Only bet what you can afford to lose. I don't want to be the reason anyone can't enjoy betting anymore! I did a big bet this time because I believe in Dig, but some of my reasoning is blind faith in them! Again, bet responsibly, and remember not to spam Twitch chat like a huge dickweed. Thank you.

"Writing this for a recently divorced friend (f/26) 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend recent got divorced from her husband (m/27) in what was a toxic and abusive relationship (4.5 years). I don’t know when it began to go south but she started telling me things like when they fought, it would get physical between them and they started taking shots at each other such “your dick is too small” or “your tits and vagina are gross”. She told me later that at one point he hit her so hard that she was concussed, at this point she was still convinced that they would work things out and things would get better. She began to feel depressed and anti-social and take heavy anti-depressants and anxiety medication, constantly upping the dosage or switching to a stronger medication. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point she began to try and seek comfort in other males. Her family is fairly distant about it and tries to avoid talking about her struggles, or flat out denies them and tells her to be a better wife and she will be happier. So she ends up cheating on him because she was wanted to be comforted and one thing led to another. She told him about it and he was furious of course, but they talked and they wanted to try and work things out so they entered couples therapy. The therapy helped a bit but it didn’t solve everything and at one point she ended up packing a bag and trying to leave while he screamed things like “no one will ever love you, you’re a disgusting whore, I hope that you die, get the fuck out of my house I never want to see you again, go fuck (guy she cheated with), go suck his cock”. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple weeks later the relationship hasn’t improved and she ends up cheating again. She complains that she just wants life to end and that she constantly feels like everything is meaningless, that she’s worthless, and that she thinks about killing herself. He ends up basically saying ‘I’m done’, and orders divorce papers. During this time, he’s calling her a gold digger and telling her to give him sums of money to pay him back for everything that he ever bought her. She has just started to see that it was a terrible and abusive relationship, she does knows that she did a terrible thing and feels like shit about it. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the couple of weeks that they have separated, he told multiple friends and family member that she cheated on him, and that she was a bad person while he was trying to become a better person and improve himself. She’s told her family her side (that she cheated and she did so because she felt alienated by her husband and sought comfort in other men) and for the most part they take her side. But one member of her immediate family has basically told her that its 100% her fault that the marriage failed and she should have basically taken the abuse, and that the husband is a great guy and she’s and idiot. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels like he’s managed to turn not only mutual friends they had, but some of her own family against her and feels completely alone. She’s told me that no one aside from her best friends care that she was physically and emotionally abused and most of her family has basically said “stop being a drama queen, whatever you do don’t kill yourself”. She wants to leave the country for about a year because she feels like she can’t even be in the same country as him, because she’s terrified that he will try to turn the rest of her family against her. She feels dead inside and has started to think that everything is all her fault and she has begun cutting herself, (which she also did during the relationship after they would have a huge fight). She doesn’t feel happy at all and never wants to return home, and is thinking about simply moving to a different country for ever to escape. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been trying to convince her that no, everything is not your fault, you’re and amazing human being who made a huge mistake that was brought on because your husband is an incredibly abusive person. I care about her deeply and don’t want to see her simply pick everything up and just run away, I’d like your opinions on the matter, I’m trying to show her that it’s not all her fault, and that he family is being incredibly unsupportive.

"Summary: What's in the title. Girls barely even register beta males on their radar. They only notice the presence of the top 20% (or even narrower) males in any given location, and fight for the right to sleep with him. 
 [Thread here.]( 
 It's always fun to see bluepillers accidentally agreeing with RP theory. You know how feminists keep telling men that there's always ""a woman out there for every guy"" and that all he needs to do is be nice and pleasant and soon he will find his star-crossed soulmate? Yeah, no. And here's the proof. OP asked AskWomen if it was true that women get sex easier than guys... and their brains immediately went into fucking overdrive. Rationalizations flying left and right like bullets in Fallujah. Let's take a look at some of the more entertaining ones. 
 >It's fairly hard to get ANYONE to have actual sex with me.
Oh, I could find someone who'd use me like a fleshlight, stick their penis in me, but ... I wouldn't get off, I wouldn't even come close, and I don't see how that counts as ""woo, I got sex"" in any but the ""I could possibly have gotten pregnant or contracted a STD"". 
 Translation: Nobody has sex with me! Well, okay, guys I don't like are lining up around the block to give me physical validation, I suppose. But that's not what sex is! Sex is only when it's an attractive alpha male pounding you, not some ugly skinny nerd."" 
 >Exactly - there is no ""yay!"" unless I find them attractive. In fact, the thought of letting someone inside me that I don't find attractive makes me want to puke. 
 Daily reminder that the presence of beta males (yes, even just the mere thought of them touching a woman) makes her want to vomit up her guts. 
 >Seriously though! I have been trying very hard to have sex for about a few weeks now with that same proposition. It's like that scares them off or something i have no idea. initially they are SO down but then they fade. and i'm left sexually frustrated and confused. 
 This chick claims that she just wants no-strings-attached sex, then she starts pouting and whining when it turns out that the guy leaves her after sex is over. Hey, bimbo, isn't that the  point  of NSA sex? I swear, women have no capability to process consistent logic... 
 >It's harder to get them to fuck you, first of all.
Because, obviously, they're a much smaller group than ""every dude I don't want to fuck,"" and they often have - because they're hot - higher standards. If I wanna bang 20% of the dudes I see, and 10% of all dudes want to bang me, 2% of the people I'd bang would be open to it, and 8% of people I don't want to sleep with would be. Factoring in the idea that hot people have higher standards, now only 5% of the hot guys would hit it, and 20% of the rest. This means that out of a hundred dudes, 17 people want to fuck me, but only one of them is someone I want to fuck. 
 The hilarious part of this above quote is that it's by... an AskWomen mod. She literally spelled out RedPill theory (women only want the very top fraction of males, the rest can go to hell) even while proclaiming herself to be a proud feminist who don't need no man. 
 (Also, later in the thread she admits she weighs 250 lbs. Further proving the theory that even a terribly unattractive woman can still get laid by at least 17/100 men at any given bar.) 
 >Definitely the second. The men I'm attracted to are usually attractive. They have options and standards. I'm not hideous but I am chubby, which is the second worst possible thing a woman can be (just after being fat/obese) according to society. Some guys might be willing to overlook my chub in favor of easy sex and my pretty face, but attractive guys, guys I'm attracted to, don't have to make tradeoffs like that. With a small amount of effort they can pull a woman with a pretty face and sexy body. 
 And finally we come to the climax. Attractive men have options. This enrages females because they're used to receiving lots of attention from betas. That's why, when Chad merely glances in their direction and smirks, they wonder - what's wrong? Why isn't he salivating over me like everyone else? Why doesn't he want to kiss my ass like all these other guys orbiting me? 
 It makes Chad a mystery, irresistible. 
 You heard it here first, folks. RedPill theory is so obvious and grounded in reasoning that even that fortress of sad feminists, AskWomen, blatantly admits that we know what's up.

"My (f 23) father (47) is an extreme non-functioning alcoholic. My parents divorced when I was 6 and I strongly feel this is the best thing my mother ever did for me. My father is so messed up, I don't even know how to properly convey it. 
 I grew up with a lot of fucked up things because of my father but have gotten past basically all of the scaring childhood moments. 
 Now I am left with a father who lives with his parents in a disgusting bedroom. It is stained with urine, and vomit. He can't keep a job because he gets fired for drinking. He earns a little bit of money, spends it on alcohol and gets drunk by himself in his bedroom. When he loses his job he lives off of unemployment to buy booze and continues to sit in his room alone and get wasted. When his unemployment runs out, he pawns whatever he can to buy more booze, and finally looks for another part-time job to work until he gets fired again. 
 He calls me drunk CONSTANTLY. I no longer check my voicemail because all the messages are just my dad going through various phases of emotions. He calls me happy, then sad, then starts cussing me out because I still won't answer, then he calls me crying because he is sorry. Then he gets pissed off again and so on and so forth. 
 I can't tell my dad where I work either, because if he finds out, he will call my work drunk if I don't answer my phone. When I was 15 I worked at sonic, and my dad would call and harass me, at sonic. He has also harassed me at other jobs until I learned to not let him know where I work. Sometimes when I don't answer my phone, even now at the age of 23, my father threatens to call the police. 
 It is literally like dealing with a crazy ex. He has zero friends because they cut him out of his life because of him drunk dialing and doing fucked up shit, and he hasn't had a girlfriend in over 10 years. I am the only person he feels he has, and he goes to me for all his issues, including complaining that he has a small penis, and not infrequently that he wants to kill himself or die. He uses me as a therapist basically, and always has. 
 My dad is drunk literally from the moment he wakes up, to the moment he passes out. On occasion he doesn't have money for alcohol and he goes through horrible withdrawals. He shakes uncontrollably, vomits, and basically won't eat. 
 I have tried being around more in hopes that support will get him to go to rehab. I have told him I am not speaking to you until you go to rehab which lasted several months until I ended up visiting my dad in the hospital. (He was there for alcohol poisoning) 
 Currently I only see my dad on major holidays. I sometimes answer when he calls mainly because I get tired of him calling me 5 times in 10 minutes. (I don't want to block his number because he lives with my grandma, and she sometimes calls me as well) 
 Our conversations are only about a few different things. The most recent conversation I had with him was him asking if I wanted to go to a baseball game with him. I told him yes, I would enjoy that, but only if he was sober and did not drink. He refused so I told him I didn't want to go then. I told him that I love him, and care about him but that I am not going to spend time with him unless he is sober. I want him to be happy and healthy and drinking is killing him and I will not support it. I told him that I want him to be in my life, but only is he was sober so it is now his choice if he wants to see me more, or drink. 
 He hung up on me, and then called me back screaming and crying about something. Then he hung up. He called back two minutes later and I did not answer. 
 I know I can't make him stop drinking, and I have accepted that but I don't know how to handle him. I don't know if what I say to him is appropriate, or possibly making things worse. 
 I am honestly mostly okay with just cutting him out of my life at this point but because he lives with my grandparents, I don't know how to maintain a relationship with them and my other family members on that side as well, if I cut him out completely. 
 I am willing to put up with him on occasion if it means getting to see the rest of my family, I just want to make sure I am handling his behavior in the best manner. 
 Oh and a list of other things I have tried. 
I have given him the number and directions to a free rehab within walking distance of his home. 
I have given him the number to an AA group within walking distance of his home.
I have offered to purchase him self help books.
I have offered to help him find a therapist. 
I have tried to be there more to see if that would help him stop drinking.
I have tried completely cutting off contact.",4670,"My alcoholic father is basically harassing me, I want to make sure I am handling him in the best way so I can still have contact with the rest of my family

"Where should I even begin. Well, let’s start from the very beginning. I come from a fucked up family. My mother always liked to tell me that I was going to “make” it. I’ve never understood that because if you come from a bunch of losers/fuck ups how can I be expected to be any better than them? Alcoholic mother ( been sober for 15 years now, though. Kudos to her.) and an absentee father. He’s always been around, but was never much of a parent. He never taught me how to be a man, talk to women etc. The only good thing he has done for me was teach me how to play sports. It’s one of the few things I get enjoyment from nowadays. Well that and music of course which seems to be the only thing that helps with racing thoughts. My grandfathers were alcoholics and my grandfather most likely abused my father when he was younger. Maybe that’s why he’s been such an absentee parent. I fuckin hate that guy and I’ve never even met him. He died an early death. Karmic justice if you ask me. I must look pretty bad trashing my grandfather but I can’t help it. My older half brother was an alcoholic among other things of which I’d rather not get into. Speaking of him, a few years ago he was hit by a drunk guy on a motorcycle (How ironic) and suffered TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) from that accident.The rest of my family on both sides are a bunch of “See you next Tuesdays” if you catch my drift. 
 In my early childhood I was supposed to be a big brother. I remember looking forward to it. Unfortunately things always go to shit for me. As you can guess, he didn’t survive long. That really fucked with me when I was young. Probably one of the first times I experienced something so tragic. I started to go to therapy around that time. Who knew that I’d still be going to therapy over 12 years later. 
 School sure was fun. I was that quiet kid who sat in the back and kept to himself. Everyone knows that guy I’m talking about. My grades were always excellent which must have given my parents the wrong idea about who I was. Anyone can memorize things for a test, that’s not true intelligence. Unlike most people who consider themselves “smart”, I don’t buy into that bullshit. Isn’t there some statistic/study that states 70% of the population believes they’re above average in intelligence? Well, we all know that isn’t possible. Unlike a lot of others, I don’t have my head up my ass thinking I’m some special little snowflake. 
 Being bipolar has definitely ruined my life. I don’t have any genuine relationships. Anyone that may have cared about me, I’ve pushed away. Family, friends, girls it doesn’t matter who. It’s something I’m great at. I can always count on myself to sabotage any potential positive relationship that may come my way. I’m starting to come to grips with the fact that I’ll be alone. It bothered me at first (and still kind of does) but I’m starting to get used to the reality of it. I’ll never become one of those people desperate for relationships though. That’s just pathetic. I’ve ruined my room, and broken so many things over the years, I can’t even count anymore. My door has a hole in it, as does my wall. My light switch is completely shattered. Suicidal ideation has ran rampant through my mind (although things have been pretty good with that lately). I’m either angry or depressed most days. Most people think I have my shit together but that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I’m on medication but I don’t even know how well they truly work for me. My thoughts race all the time. My mind never shuts off. I spend hours trying to sleep while my thoughts constantly race. My “friends” think I’m an eternal pessimist. Honestly, i don’t even know how to be positive. People always ask me about my future and I give them some bullshit answer. I don’t even think I have a future. 
 I went to a prestigious top 50 university. I didn’t like it there much and was not putting forth any effort. Had a 2.7 while I was there which is trash. So, I decided to transfer to a lesser school to get away from home and have a good time. Turns out I can’t even have an enjoyable time. What a surprise. I don’t even know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. It’s most likely incoherent babble at this point. Hell, this is so long I doubt anyone is going to read this. Honestly, I wouldn’t. I don’t blame anyone if they don’t read this. It’s just a depressing rant that shouldn’t even be cared about. 
 This is getting close to a thousand words by now, so I guess I should stop. It’s just that some days I’m so stuck in my own mind that I just need to write my thoughts down no matter how incoherent they may be.

"What the fuck is this? This is not a mother fucking game. Don't come in here with your weak ass circle measure like this is a fucking joke. Don't show up like you are ready to throw down. Do you know who I am bitch? Do you comprehend the mess you just started? I am a metrology engineer motherfucker. While you were sitting there, with your snide ass giggles like you just one-up-ed me, I was warming up my $45,000 vision inspection system. 
 That's right, you just done started a war. You came in here to challenge a man that just got his fancy new machine back from NIST traceable 3rd party calibration TODAYand was looking for an excuse to warm it up. You just tried to sucker punch am man who just so happen to have his mother-in-law at his house staying the week. I ain't got nothing to lose little man. 
 That's right son, you walked up on a man who has raw talent to spare and all the time in the world. I may not have the drawing in person but I can sure as hell turn what I got into process image. Then use a vision inspection system to bring it back into the computer. Then take that image and reverse engineer it into a 2d drawing. Then do some relative circularity measurements from my rendering. Take this shit bitch. 
 Wait, what was that? Did you just challenge my core methodology? Oh no you didn't. Don't try to tell me I am making things over complex: taking an image file from the internet and printing it out, then turning it back into digital with some fancy 3D camera measurement system, then reverse engineering that into an engineering drawing. 
 This isn't about GR&R and the process weakness of digital -> modified digital-> physical -> digital again -> 2d print -> relative measure. Motherfucker, did you miss the part about my mother-in-law? This is as complex as I can make it because that is the point motherfucker, I got a mother-in-law AT MY FUCKING HOUSE! 
 This war will never end. 
 EDIT: Yeah, it has been an hour. So what? I'm still here man with a little circle doodle. All I hear is some <chirp> <chirp> like you got better things to do. Well I don't bitch, I'm still here. MOTHER-IN-LAW, I ain't never going home. 
 EDIT2: Oh shit. /u/kevie3drinks responded with some week ass movie screen screen grab. I'm still not going, this isn't over. 
 ──────── 
 EDIT Final: I don't have a good apology for taking over OP's thread so I offer this. If Op sends me a PM, I will give him my address so he can send me his drawing. Then I will provide him with a proper measure that accounts for the waves in the paper, lighting, and camera setup. 
 EDIT LEAVE MY POOR INBOX ALONE!: I thought I was done but I guess not since I work up to a bunch of messages. First off let me come out and say that in no way was my measurement accurate. It was total BS as was how I said it. Seriously people, you can not take a picture of circle at an angle, send it as a medium resolution image across the internet, then modify it, then print it out, then scan that printout into some fancy machine, then reverse engineer that into a drawing, and then final make assumptions about the circle from the drawing you made. It is total nonsense. Someone said my science was 3/10, that is way too kind. Total BS. 
 My joke was that it was funny how serious we were going to take measuring this circle. If you notice my first post in the thread you will notice that I haphazardly put a reference circle next to the drawn circle and said it looked close. Then /u/kevie3drinks posted a response with a even crazier response, at that point I said fuck it - going big and crazy. To be honest I figured a 3rd level comment of something in a small thread was going to get just a few views. Then /r/bestof hit and things went crazy. 
 The funny ones were people talking the accuracy of measuring seriously and that somehow I did some great disservice to the cause of truth by not taking into account the angle of the picture. That was the point, nothing I was doing was accurate or serious in any way. It was 100% delivery and 2% substance. Hell, I didn't even look at the final numbers before I posted then screen grab. The whole point was to be as silly and complex as possible. This is the type of thing that people that work in labs do to amuse themselves.

"What the fuck is this? This is not a mother fucking game. Don't come in here with your weak ass circle measure like this is a fucking joke. Don't show up like you are ready to throw down. Do you know who I am bitch? Do you comprehend the mess you just started? I am a metrology engineer motherfucker. While you were sitting there, with your snide ass giggles like you just one-up-ed me, I was warming up my $45,000 vision inspection system. 
 That's right, you just done started a war. You came in here to challenge a man that just got his fancy new machine back from NIST traceable 3rd party calibration TODAYand was looking for an excuse to warm it up. You just tried to sucker punch am man who just so happen to have his mother-in-law at his house staying the week. I ain't got nothing to lose little man. 
 That's right son, you walked up on a man who has raw talent to spare and all the time in the world. I may not have the drawing in person but I can sure as hell turn what I got into process image. Then use a vision inspection system to bring it back into the computer. Then take that image and reverse engineer it into a 2d drawing. Then do some relative circularity measurements from my rendering. Take this shit bitch. 
 Wait, what was that? Did you just challenge my core methodology? Oh no you didn't. Don't try to tell me I am making things over complex: taking an image file from the internet and printing it out, then turning it back into digital with some fancy 3D camera measurement system, then reverse engineering that into an engineering drawing. 
 This isn't about GR&R and the process weakness of digital -> modified digital-> physical -> digital again -> 2d print -> relative measure. Motherfucker, did you miss the part about my mother-in-law? This is as complex as I can make it because that is the point motherfucker, I got a mother-in-law AT MY FUCKING HOUSE! 
 This war will never end. 
 EDIT: Yeah, it has been an hour. So what? I'm still here man with a little circle doodle. All I hear is some <chirp> <chirp> like you got better things to do. Well I don't bitch, I'm still here. MOTHER-IN-LAW, I ain't never going home. 
 EDIT2: Oh shit. /u/kevie3drinks responded with some week ass movie screen screen grab. I'm still not going, this isn't over. 
 ──────── 
 EDIT Final: I don't have a good apology for taking over OP's thread so I offer this. If Op sends me a PM, I will give him my address so he can send me his drawing. Then I will provide him with a proper measure that accounts for the waves in the paper, lighting, and camera setup. 
 EDIT LEAVE MY POOR INBOX ALONE!: I thought I was done but I guess not since I work up to a bunch of messages. First off let me come out and say that in no way was my measurement accurate. It was total BS as was how I said it. Seriously people, you can not take a picture of circle at an angle, send it as a medium resolution image across the internet, then modify it, then print it out, then scan that printout into some fancy machine, then reverse engineer that into a drawing, and then final make assumptions about the circle from the drawing you made. It is total nonsense. Someone said my science was 3/10, that is way too kind. Total BS. 
 My joke was that it was funny how serious we were going to take measuring this circle. If you notice my first post in the thread you will notice that I haphazardly put a reference circle next to the drawn circle and said it looked close. Then /u/kevie3drinks posted a response with a even crazier response, at that point I said fuck it - going big and crazy. To be honest I figured a 3rd level comment of something in a small thread was going to get just a few views. Then /r/bestof hit and things went crazy. 
 The funny ones were people talking the accuracy of measuring seriously and that somehow I did some great disservice to the cause of truth by not taking into account the angle of the picture. That was the point, nothing I was doing was accurate or serious in any way. It was 100% delivery and 2% substance. Hell, I didn't even look at the final numbers before I posted then screen grab. The whole point was to be as silly and complex as possible. This is the type of thing that people that work in labs do to amuse themselves. It was great seeing lots of legit attempts to measure the circle and a few other metrology/calibration folks in the thread having some fun.

"There are some seriously serious flaws with a lot of the math and logic in this post. I'm not going to go into that great of detail, as many of the problems have probably already been addressed, but this is a classic case of surface-level/over generalization/twerk the numbers to my advantage argumentation. I know all people aren't like this, but if you want to buy a house, no matter what your situation is, you are an idiot if you don't read read read and learn learn learn as much as you possibly can. A post like this that makes understanding mortgage amortization appear like a super-secret hidden thing that will fuck you in the ass--it's patronizing and outright dangerous. The tone of this post is meant to be helpful, but like anything that assesses financial strategies as absolutes is really really irresponsible. TONS of liberties have been taken here to make buying in the short term sound really dangerous and dumb. Here are some issues I have: 
 
 Mortgage Insurance--this will not apply to a very large portion of financially responsible people. If you can't afford 20% down, many people say you shouldn't be trying to buy a house in the first place. 94$ out of OP's 1580$ monthly figure is 6% of the total--this is not insignificant. 
 
 Tax benefits of owning are ignored and, in fact, taxes are touted as a major reason why buying short term sucks. Even in short term, primary residence tax benefits are pretty incredible, especially for middle-income folks (which would apply to a younger married couple traveling around in the military). All interest, mortgage points, and property taxes are deductible. Do the math for your specific situation to see how it works. Bank Rate has a good calculator--rough estimate for first year tax savings on the parameters OP gave are about $3k. That's 250 dollars a month. That you can invest in your 401k come April, or negate any repair fund money you didn't save during the year. 
 
 Mortgage terms--why in the goddamn fuckall would someone who knows they are moving in 4ish years buy a 30 year fixed mortgage? There is nothing wrong with variable interest rates, ESPECIALLY if the borrower knows they are on track to move around a lot. 4.5%?!?! Why the hell did OP ignore VA mortgage rates? 2.5-3.5% is totally within reach right now. .75% in OPs example is $100 per month, every month. 
 
 ""You can invest/save what equity you would be building, plus you don't take on the risk of owning the home""--the only equity that was referred to in OP's post is what you build from paying down principal. How can you say that investing a small amount of money (OP says principal is low anyways for the first x years of mortgage amortization) is automatically better than the upside potential of appreciation. It sounds like the example OP is using is essentially the worst-case scenario in housing. The risks of investing anything over keeping up with inflation have inherent risks too--it's not free money just because. Even if you take the 4% liberty of compound interest, investing that ""equity savings"" you'd have by renting, you'd only accrue about $1500 over the 4 years. Your first year of tax liability savings is double that had you purchased. Not to mention potential for appreciation. 
 
 
 Just to prove my point--I put in some of the figures into NYT's Rent vs. buy calculator (which I suspect OP also used). The only way OPs numbers make sense is if your home appreciates 0%, rent increases 0%, and you get an automatic 4% return on investment. Kind of cherry-picking, don't you think? As soon as you start making a couple percent on appreciation, things get seriously different. Even at 2% appreciation, with 0% rent increase, your 1600 number drops to 1150 for the sweet spot to rent instead of buy--even with all of the shitty hidden costs associated with buying. I know a lot of the country is cheaper than where I live, but I did some research. 
 I searched some military base locations around the US and saw a trend after 3 or 4 in terms of rent prices and purchase prices--not uncommon to see trends. I'll only post one example, as this came out as ""average"" in my 5 searches. Say you get relocated to Luke AFB outside of Phoenix. For 250k, you can purchase this: 
 If you rent, $1750 gets you this: 
 Both nice houses, the purchase home is much larger, and would likely need very very little upkeep in 4-5 years. 40k of remodeling, plus the home was built only 10 years ago, so major issues like roof/structural repairs are unlikely. Appreciation for the next 5 years is likely to keep up with the 10 year average of 2% in that area. 
 There is no one answer, and you and your family need to decide what works best for you, but I couldn't not respond to this post and point out some of the really important nuances that were left out. Do your due diligence and check OP's numbers/allowances/assumptions.",4878,"This post is overly simple and don't take financial advise from strangers. Do your reading and learn how all of this shit works before you decide to rent or buy. Don't tell the internet that buying/selling every 4 years is stupid for everyone because of numbers x and y.

"Okay, so this fuck up is more or less drunken fun gone badly. Similar stories that any high school or college student could recount for you. Anyways, as any TIFU goes, it didn’t happen today. Although it happened very recently. A little background: my friends and I were having an extremely shitty weekend/day. We really wanted to kill two jack-asses that had hurt another person in our friend-group. And I don’t mean something like, “Oh. My. God. Brad totally kissed Selena and now we have to kick Brad’s ass because Jenny is totally in tears because Brad legitly promised that they’d have like forty kids and a dog” nothing like that. I mean major federal instances that I won’t get into because it’s not my story to tell. Basically we decided, “Dude! We have enough money for booze. That means we’re getting booze!” So we got a 6 pack of bitch-beers and got buzzed (and it’s been a long time since any of us have had alcohol, so we were buzzed enough to be calm). And being as we were still able to think we were making all sorts of calls so we could acquire more booze. After about an hour or so we found a guy. For the sake of secrecy, we’ll call him Sir Chill. Seriously though, probably the chilliest guy you will EVER meet. But he said he would bring Mike’s Harder lemonade as well as a bottle of wine. He couldn't come over until 10-10:30-ish, but we were ready to get plastered so to us it was worth the wait. Keep in mind three out of the six of us had school the next morning. To answer your question, yes. We are indeed the smartest young adults in the universe. But to take out some of the boredom and pointless yammering about waiting we’ll fast-forward to 10 something. Sir Chill arrives with said promised booze and we’re all stoked. Sir Chill decides that we should all play and drinking game and it was a 10/10, I highly recommend it. The game is called King’s Cup. For those that have never played it’s where you have a deck of cards and each person in the group pulls a card and each card means something different that you have to do. If you’re really curious, look this up:  Needless to say we got drunk, but that wasn't enough. Sir Chill had a credit card and was like, “Dude, let’s make another beer run!” Of course we’re all in agreeance and load into a tiny car, drunk. We ended up getting out and letting the one sober person of age go it alone in the event that we were pulled over. So when they get back we finished our drinking game. So, all in all we each had about four beers per person and together we polished off four bottles of wine. We were pretty drunk. 


    So here’s where the fuck up starts. My friend (we’ll call her Hope) has her empty Mike’s Hard lemonade (from the second alcohol run) bottle and asks the drunk friend-group a question. “Hey guys! Want to watch me break this bottle on my car?” We’re all like, “Dude! Yes! That sounds so fun!” But only two of us, myself included, went outside with her. Now the three of us gather around by the car and Hope is like, “Ok guys, I’m going to throw it.” We’re waiting and then she just chucks it at the car. We hear a loud PING and then nothing else. She threw it a little high, so we never got to see it break and we couldn't find it afterward. We decided it was stupid anyhow and went back inside. Now, my friend’s trailer is pretty crowded so we almost always have to sleep on the floor. That night we decided we’d sleep in the cars. Granted, it was cold but we had blankets. Hope’s car, on the other hand, has a window that won’t roll-up so we knew it would be even colder. But when Hope and I got into the car and it was even colder than usual, we both wondered why but never openly questioned it. Our other friend (we’ll call her Jodi) came outside and knocked on the back window telling us that it was too cold and that sleeping inside was better. Hope was ready to, but I’m stubborn. After a few minutes (at 2:30) I decided to say fuck it and go back inside. Now, it’s dark. So I turn on the flash-light on my phone so as to see where we were going. I look over at the back windshield and it’s smashed. Turns out the bottle hit harder and damaged more than we expected. So I look over at Hope and tell her that she broke her windshield. She doesn't believe me and after a minute or so of protesting I shine the light on it. She’s like, “Holy shit! I broke my windshield!!” All in all, it was actually okay. It’s her asshole of a mother’s car because although she’s given the car to Hope, it’s not yet in her name. We ended up sleeping inside. The next morning we spent awhile looking for the bottle, just so you know we still haven’t found it. And we all went to school, barely woke up in time, but we went none-the-less. I felt like barfing most of the day, but it was all worth it. We had fun and now we all have a funny little story to tell when recounting our high school years.",4884,My friends and I got drunk and ended up shattering the back windshield of my friend's car.,90,0.9497779607772828,0.0131668495014309,0.0500004105269908,0.0001910159626277,0.8953357338905334,0.0012472775997593,0.0387863665819168,0.0001842130004661,0.3031116127967834,0.0006835958338342,0.0247004050761461,0.0002652424445841,A group of friends decided to get drunk after a bad weekend.

"If you have a problem, fix it If you want something, go for it 
 First a little intro, this is spurred by one thing I've realized in my thoughts lately. I see this with everything going on at the international level with all these protests or revolutions or whatever you wish to call them, and at a local level with things I've seen around me. If you have a problem, fix it.
  I see it in everyday life. People think that their problems will go away if they ignore them. Maybe they'll go away for a little bit, but they'll come back, and by god they'll come back at the worst possible time. Nobody ever accomplished anything big by sitting and doing nothing. George Washington didn't just sit there, he crossed that fucking river like a boss, because he wasn't afraid to take a little risk when things came down to it. He didn't sit there and wait for the British troops to attack him, he went and he made an effort to fix his problems. Sorry for you Redditors not familiar with US History, but I'm kind of writing this with whatever pops into my head, and that did. But look through your countries history, look for people in your history. Look at people you'd consider your idols, I can bet with 99% certainty that they worked their asses of to fix their problems, unless your idol is some guy who didn't work for anything and ended up with an amazing life, if so, go roll in your money for a while.
  I thought of this last night and saved it to my phone because I never want to forget it. Life is like the game of football, the harder you hit your problems, the less they hit back. Now there is some explanation to go with that. First of all, I mean American Football to be clear. Next, I don't mean physically hitting someone, but that if you face your problems head on, and you fight them, your much more likely to succeed. If you cower, and you let your problems hit you harder, you're going to fall flat on your back, and coach is going to pull you of and ask you what the fuck is going on. This also leads to another thing, if you fall flat on your back, get up and hit twice as hard the next time. Never give up. No one ever won by giving up. No one. Winner fight until they don't have any fight left. And then they fight more. If you give up in life, you lose. You've let the problems win. And I mean give up at any degree, from quitting the team, to allowing yourself to chase someone who doesn't reciprocate the feelings, to at the worst suicide or self harm. Never give up. Now, on to my second point 
 If you want something, work for it. They say the best things in life are free. Too bad we only look at money when we say that. The best things in life are going to cost you not in money, but in blood, sweat, and tears. If you didn't work for it, chances are that theres better out there. Its the way our life works. Its why we see the future as bleak, because people in this new generation (I'll admit it is mine, I'm probably very young for reddit, and for this kind of thinking in general) don't care to work. They want everything to come to them on a silver platter. They don't realize that it isn't going to happen. We don't have some magical utopia where things are just going to be given to you free of charge and your life will be perfect. That doesn't happen. Call me a cynic, but I don't believe that a utopia is even possible in practicality. Thats a discussion for another time though. My point here is that you have to work for the things you want. Its never going to be easy. I see it hurt people all too often. I have a poster from the Shawshank Redemption, and the tagline says ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"". By whatever god you choose to (not) believe in, thats the truest thing I've ever read. If you're constantly afraid of whats going to happen, you're never going to cross the Delaware, you're never going to march into Washington DC for your civil rights, you're never going to get the best things in life. I've seen it happen all too much in society. I see people in relationships that go on way too long, because they're afraid to end it, despite the fact that it isn't healthy for either of them. I see people who are afraid to chase a relationship because they're afraid of what might happen. People, being afraid never got shit done. Yeah things are going to be difficult, but its more than worth it in the end when you feel that satisfaction and that knowing that you really have gotten the best things.

Today, her newest thing, is to lie to my mother and my father separately (I was present for both conversations) about other family members. She makes me father sound completely horrible toward my mother and acts as though she is ""helping"" my mom out and on her side, yet when she spoke to my father she had completely insane things to say about my mom. She turns them against each other even more and they have been divorced since I was 4.
My sister was such a horrible child when she was younger that she would physically assault my mother and I daily, so she was sent to a help center, where she was basically locked away for a few years. My family welcomed her home with open arms. My sister was still shitty to my mom and sneaked out every night in her teen years to do drugs and lie and steal from out family every chance she got. When I would confront her, or tell someone, I ended up getting the wrath of it. Fast forward to her moving to Arizona with her boyfriend, (now husband) she convinced my mom to send me to visit her for a month. When I got there she basically ransacked me of all my money, so that she could buy alcohol and drugs. Everything was fine and dandy after that, until the day she moved back home to get married.
She gained TONS of weight from being addicted to pills, alcohol heroine, etc... and ended up stealing thousands of dollars from my mother, father, and me. She never repaid us, even when we demanded it and caught her red handed. To this day she denies ever having stole a thing! She ended up in rehab, because she miscarried due to being on drugs while pregnant. She blamed my mom and I for not caring about her, because we were too busy working to run to the nest town over to go to her meetings with her and her husband. Anything that goes wrong is ALWAYS someone else's fault.
She later found out my ex boyfriend would abuse me terribly and befriended him. She even told my dad that I ""deserved it."" He was furious about this and I hate to see how hurt he was to find out. She still tells him where I am and he stalks me, looking for my car etc.. even though I have a restraining order in 3 states against him! She also scooped up my very best friend and made her believe horrendous things that I never said, or did! I guess she wasn't such a great friend if she would believe that stuff, so I cut my losses from all of them.
Recently I have been keeping my distance and visiting my mom and dad regularly. When she keeps coming to my mom's house (where I live now) and telling my mom these horrible things, trying to ensure inheritance, etc.. for herself I cannot help, but to get outraged. I explain to my mom and dad what she is doing, but they are so heartbroken by her, that they let it go and sometimes choose not to believe any of it. She will make up lie after lie about petty things and try to back them if I confront her. I feel like everyone cowers down to her about everything and I am the only one who will stand up for anyone. I am not a confrontational person, so I come off very sweetly toward these things, so I know I am in no way like her. No one would even guess we are sisters. I feel like nothing can stop her. She is going behind my dad's back and making his own brother hate him even more, because they don't have a good relationship and trying to ensure his inheritance to her, while trying to make sure I don't get a thing. She said this to me today and I told her the truth, that I don't care about any of it and I think it's sad she is waiting for people to die. He is not even rich, or anything! She told me to go fuck myself. What makes me hate her the most? EVERY SINGLE TIME she sees me she says, ""-(name of company I work for)-- sucks!"" It is so childish and annoying. She keeps repeating it and repeating it over and over, as if chanting it to me. I explained to her once that I don't care, because I don't own it, I just work there and she continued to follow me saying it. 
 My own sister is literally someone I would never ever give another thought, or glance to in my entire life. It seems as though there's a unwritten rule that people have to love their family more than anyone in the world. She is literally the worst person I have, or could ever meet. Why stick around for someone who causes nothing but pain, when there are so many other wonderful, compatible people in this world? Am I the only one who thinks the concept of being stuck with a horrible person from birth is absolutely insane? 
 Thanks for giving thought.

"Happy Monday, FPS!  Fuck Mondays. 
 To distract myself from how slowly the clock insists upon moving, I will regale you with a tale of the time a porker  tried out for the major leagues  went ham^lol in a dollar store. 
 > be Hyde, impoverished, shopper at One-Cent-Under-a-Full-Dollar Store 
 > avoid being Helpful Employee, it never ends well for them in these stories 
 > don’t be the dirty trailer trash that is Hammy-Jane. Just don’t. 
 I first noticed Hammy-Jane in the parking lot. Nobody gets a gold star for guessing what she was doing, because we’ve heard variations of what she was doing many, many times. Hammy-Jane was yelling and flapping her batwings at an embarrassed middle-aged woman who was leaning heavily on a cane. The woman had just exited a vehicle parked in the disabled spot. 
 > YUR NOT DISABULLED! 
 > DAT SPOT IS FUR PEEPLE WIT CUNDISHUNZ LAHK ME! 
 > YOU DUN NEED ET, AH DO! 
 I would like to say that I did something heroic, but the husband of the middle-aged woman appeared and immediately began defending his wife. 
 > She IS disabled, we have a placard, and we have every right to park here. 
 > SHADDUP YEW PROLLY STOLED IT! 
 > If you do not leave my wife alone I will call the police and let them settle this. 
 Hammy-Jane harrumphed at the mention of police and waddled away in a huff. Upon reaching the door, she wrenched a push-cart out of a  total strangers hands  and march-shuffled into the store with her nose in the air. The man whose cart had been stolen and I made eye contact for a brief moment. We shook our heads and entered the store. 
 Hammy-Jane was not visible for the majority of the time I was shopping, but I could  hear  her damn near anywhere. Bitch was LOUD. 
 > WHARR’S THE CUNDENSED MEE-YULK? 
 > DO YUH ALL HAF BUDDER THIS WEEK? 
 > LAST TAHME AH WUZ HEER, YUH ALL HAD KING SAHZE CHOCKLIT BARRRS. WHARR DEY AT? 
 > EH MUH GAWD, AH LUV DESE MASHM'LOWS! 
 (For those of you less versed in the cadences of fatspeak, that’s condensed milk, butter, king sized chocolate bars, and marshmallows.) 
 I finally caught up to Hammy-Jane in the least likely of places – the produce section. She had two carts, full to overflowing; one that she pushed and one that she pulled. Anyone who has ever attempted this will tell you that it is immensely difficult to steer a shopping cart with one hand, especially if it’s heavy. 
 Hammy-Jane left a trail of destruction behind her as she shoved and barreled along with her haul. She had cleaned out the cereal aisle, leaving behind anything with fiber or whole wheat.  Instant mac and cheese. Canned cinnamon apple pie filling. Bags of cinnamon raisin bagels. Bottles upon bottles of alfredo sauce, cans of Cheese Whiz, at least three of everything from the frozen meal and dessert section… It was impressive. It was horrifying. 
 Behind her, anything she collided with toppled to the floor. Paper towel rolls littered the floor, followed by bottles of dish soap, several cans of green beans, and a whole shelf’s worth of White Rain shampoo. And that was just one aisle. Helpful Employee scuttled around behind her in a panic, trying to right everything. 
 Hammy-Jane was in search of fruit. I pretended to check apples for brown spots as I spied on her. She passed the oranges, pears, and apples, knocking a number of said fruit to the floor from their bins, before grabbing three plastic containers of grapes. Helpful Employee caught up to her, clearly out of breath, as she paused at the avocados. 
 > WHUT THE HAIL ARE DESE? 
 > Those are avocados, ma’am. 
 > NAH DEY AIN’T, AVUH-CAWDOES ARE ORNGE. DESE ARE GREEN. 
 Helpful Employee blinked. 
 > Avocados are green, ma’am … These are avocados. 
 > WHAY YEW LYIN’ TUH ME? IF THESE’N ARE AVUH-CADOES, DEY MUST BE ROTTIN. 
 > Uhm … they aren’t entirely ripened yet, ma’am. 
 > OH YEAH? AH BET AH KIN MAKE ‘UM SPLATTER! 
 And with that declaration, Hammy-Jane wound up and  pitched the avocado . Then another, and another, and another, like a vengeful baseball-pitching machine. Helpful Employee dived behind the apple bin, and people scattered. 
 I noped the hell out and headed to the registers. On the way to the front of the store, I was passed by a blur I believe may have been a manager. Thanks to her formidable lungpower, I could still hear Hammy-Jane’s whale song at the front of the store. 
 > NAH I WON’T GO! 
 > YUR EMPLUHYEE WUZ LYIN’! 
 > DIS DISCRIMINATUZASHUN, AH’LL SUE YUH! 
 > AH HAVE CUNDISHUNS, GET AWAY! 
 >WHUT ABOWT MAH FOOD? 
 I was considering going back to see who was winning when three police officers entered the store and ran towards the noise. My items were being rung up when they dragged a kicking, howling, snarling, warbling, whaling, weeping Hammy-Jane out the front door. 
 > YUH ALL ARE FAT SHAMIN’ BASTERDS! YUH’LL PAY FER DIS! 
 Hammy-Jane was arrested for property damage, causing a disturbance, resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, oh, and shoplifting – she had 8 of those king sized chocolate bars in her purse.

"Bro, I don't think you're being racist so much as you are seeing that no skin color/ethnic group is immune from having gigantic fucking assholes. 
 I've spent the majority of my life in Utah, which is about as cookie-cutter WASPy as you can get.  Actually, I lied, there's a pretty substantial Latino population there as well, but the area I lived was basically either white people or Latinos.  And we tended to keep to ourselves.  I spent a few years overseas in Japan, which is about as homogenous as you can get.  It was there that I saw the effects of crazy-ass Japanese racism when I met a Nigerian guy who was unfairly locked in prison for ten years for not accepting Yakuza bribes.  He broke his elbow there and they refused to treat it properly.  Now is arm is all fucked up and the Japanese government ain't gonna do shit for him.  It's fucked. 
 It wasn't till I got to experience the wonderous cultural melting pot that is Army Basic Training that I really gained my colorblindness, though.  I don't give a shit what your skin color is or how different you are from me -- all I care about is that you're not a shitty person.  The three shittiest people in our platoon were all black girls.  They were entitled and incredibly racist.  Any criticism on them by anyone was always countered with accusations of racism and discrimination.  That wasn't the case at all -- they were just shitty people.  I met a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds who were really different from me that I would still trust my life to any day of the week -- and I met a lot who I wouldn't.  Skin color doesn't matter, though: black, white, latino, asian, whatever...I don't care.  You can be a shit person regardless of your skin color and background.   You can also be a great person regardless of it. 
 Now, honestly, I think you're just beginning to see the unfairness of the system.  I liked how you brought up Trayvon Martin and the whole media circus surrounding it.  I don't agree with George Zimmerman's actions and I think he's a douche as well as an incredibly irresponsible CCW holder, but Trayvon was in no way, shape, or form the innocent little angel the media made him out to be.  He was, let's be real here, an asshole.  He'd always brag about his fights and bullying on Twitter and Facebook.  He was getting into trouble a lot.  In the cold and brutal calculus of life, he probably wasn't going to end up anywhere.  That doesn't justify Zimmerman's actions at all, but when the media heard about a black teen getting shot by a white guy, they saw a Gilded Ratings Cash Cow and spun the ever-loving shit out of it.  They took a mistaken and irresponsible case of neighborhood vigilantism and turned it into a modern-day lynching.  To me, that says a lot more about the current mass media influence on our cultural perceptions of ""racism"" more than anything else. 
 I feel like there's still an undercurrent of ""white guilt"" being perpetuated by our media that's unnecessary.  If you're black and I think you're an asshole, it's because you're an asshole, not because I'm still somehow hold the same views as a specific group of white Americans that I can't even claim any kind of ancestry to or because the color of your skin actually registers in my brain as a thing to dislike you for. 
 I think it's ridiculous, and in a lot of ways I feel like we've been led into kind of a bizarro ""white guilt"" culture, where ""you're racist"" becomes a trump card that can be used against anyone who has a legitimate criticism towards someone black (or, really, of any skin color).  It's insane.  How can we ever work towards truly acknowledging and treating each other as equals with this kind of thing still in the way?  Not by ""checking our privileges.""  It's only by working to improve ourselves as individuals and surrounding ourselves with the same kind of people who don't care about color or ""privilege"".  That shit snowballs and grows and expands and catches on.  Until it does, though, too many people are going to be too caught up in ""-isms"" to really be able to take a look at the big, real picture.  Y'know the best way to fight racism (or any other kind of ""ism"" for that matter)?   It's to quit classifying things with -isms in the first place.   The more fucks you give it, the more you let them wield it as a tool against you.  I'm not saying to be apathetic about injustice and unfairness.  Quite the opposite.  But the injustice spreads on a much more colossal scale that just ""sexism"" or really stupid Tumblr bullshit like ""ableism.""  Humanity is digging its collective grave deeper and deeper every day while insane psychopaths at the top of the chain consolidate their wealth and power and control.  By being caught up in all our trifling bullshit ""-isms"", all we're really doing is deepening the divide amongst ourselves, and the time will come when it'll be too late to try to take the reins back into our own hands.  A house divided amongst itself cannot stand.  I believe the people at the top understand this perfectly and exploit it as much as possible. 
 We're all  Homo Sapiens , living on the same goddamn planet that we're running into the ground so a miniscule portion of us can have a greater portion of an imaginary medium of exchange.  We have far more important things to worry about and change than whether one's ancestors are better adapted to a warm/sunny or cold/winter environment.",5428,"it's not about the fedora on your head, it's about the fedora on your heart.  all races/cultures have assholes and good people

"For a long time now I have been trying to get my soon to be wife into the idea of having sex with others. 
 This all goes back to a drunken night 5 years ago when she told me that she was glad that I was her boyfriend in university because had she been single she would have probably gotten a lot of stds. 
 We have been together for over 10 years and are each others firsts. So the idea of sharing her with others is so hot to me. She fucks like a pornstar and her oral skills are amazing with a libido that wants sex 3-5 times a day! 
 So this morning I sent her this story about a dream I had. 
 So had I not had to go into work this morning...you would have woken up to me inside you.... 
 I'll had such a dirty dream about you I'm still slightly hard. 
 You had come home saying that you won free tickets for dinner and clubbing at a new club behind the sex shop on St laurent. So Friday rolls around and you come out wearing your blue dress and those super hot laser red heels. When I remark on them you just giggled and said poor things need to be used they looked lonely. 
 So I am in a nice suit jacket and jeans with no oil stains lol. And we get in the car. When we get to the club it's very tasteful with lots of tables and low lighting. But each table is in its own room. With large benches around the tables. We go and sit down and order. The food is amazing and we are finishing up dessert when we start to hear the music start up and see people walking around socializing. 
 A couple around our age comes up and starts talking to you. And I excuse myself to head to the wash room. In there I can plainly see 2 people in 1 stale and she is on her knees. So I quickly finish up my business and head back to tell you. I see that the couple as been joined by another and are sitting very close to you. You look at me and whip our your phone to text me as I walk across the club. 
 ""This is a F@#$ing swingers club""! Your text says. 
 By the time I get to the table I can hear both couples talking about how there is never a new couple anymore and when there is they certainly are not as sexy as us. 
 I ask to speak to you privately and the 2 couples leave. But are hovering. 
 I ask you if you want to leave and we talk about it. But we agree that it could be fun to watch what goes on. People watching at its finest. 
 We wave to the waitress and she comes over and you order a large Harvey walbanger and me a old fashion. And we sit back and start to watch. 
 About an hour later we are fixed on the first couple that talked to you. She is blonde and smaller things with waves in 
 Her hair. And he is tall dark and handsome. She has the top of her dress pulled down exposing a pink push up bustier with polka dots. And she has her eyes fixed on you as her husband is kissing her neck. 
 I ask you how uou are doing and you place my hand between your legs and I feel how soaking wet you are. I am hard instantly. 
 The blonde sees that and stands up and walks right toward you. Her hips swaying with every step in her tall heels. She gets to our table and leans in and kisses you. Lightly at first but once she realized that you weren't going to pull away grabbed your head and kissed you deep. Moaning as your tounges met. 
 She stands up and grabs you by your hand and leads you away from me back to their table. Winking as she walks away. 
 She pushes you down on the table and is between your legs kissing you and fondling your breasts. I see her husband come up behind her and lifts her dress and shows me she isn't wearing anything. As he slips inside his wife...who is still passionately making out with you. 
 I walk over not knowing what to do. And you tell me quickly to just sit. I do so. And watch as this blonde starts removing your panties and starts to licking and suck on your clit. You start to moan at the same time as the blonde who's husband is thrusting harder and harder into her from behind. Both of you cum at the same time . 
 As your coming down from your orgasm . She spins around and straddles your face and starts licking you again. You without even hesitating start licking her when you feel her husband start to push into you. You quickly say stop and look at me. Who is really hard and looking like my pants will explode at any moment and ask if it's OK. 
 I can only nod as I drink in every curve and bead of sweet on you as your eyes roll back into your head as he slips inside you. 
 He moans about how tight you are and the blonde comments about your perfect pussy. And stars to licking your clit as he slowly thrusts inside you. 
 I hear you moaning as another orgasm flows through you. And I hear him moaning as if he's about to come. His wife smiles and says that as much as she loves this his cum his hers and pulls him out of you and finishes him in her mouth. 
 You're dripping with sweat and your skin and body looks fantastic in the light. When I go to stand up and grab your panties you tell me to sit. 
 You say it's only fair that I get some pleasure too. And you unbuckle my pants and pull me out. The blonde gasps and say to you if she had known I had such a nice cock that she would have taken care of me sooner. And both of you kneel between my legs and share me. Licking sucking spitting and occasionally making out with each other. You look at me knowing I'm about to explode and start jerk me off onto your chest. 
 I feel my orgasm coming.... 
 And my alarm goes off.

"Hello  Lady Perverts, 
 I’m looking for an articulate and imaginative female to role play as a sweet little sister for me. I’m looking to play properly (on skype or sexytimechat)  around this time tomorrow (maybe a few hours earlier).. and i may be on periodically between now and then to reply to pms. The premise of the scene is that I’ve hypnotised you,  I’ve made you more playful and obedient. I’ve posted a story  here . 
 My turn ons are 
 Attitude-  I would want you to enjoy it I don’t like the idea of hurting you just embarrassing and humiliating you, making you uncomfortable.. I’d want you to be  unwilling verbally but obedient physically.. if that makes sense.. just read the dam story.. 
 Oral  – i like demanding blow jobs whenever i like, maybe your trying to get your home work done and I come in turn your chair around.. or maybe we are watching a film and you suddenly find your head in my lap... you might say no, but you always seem to end up with my cock in your cute mouth. 
 Anal  – one of my favourite kinks, i love the image of you squirming in my lap or bent over your deks  as i lube you up and streach you out with fingers. Make you take a but plug for an hour or so. Have you clean your room or tie you up. And then once you’ve gotten used to your ass being full, and lernt to enjoy it. I can pop your toy out and you’ve got a nice lube up stretched out butthole all ready to be enjoyed.. whats not to love?. 
 I also like the idea of making you believe you accidently offered your little tushy to me.Maybe you agreed to be my “anal girl” (without knowing what it meant) instead of getting another spanking. Or maybe, with hypnosis,  I make you believe you lost a bet (you bet your ass :P ). 
Its weirdly specific, i know, we don’t have to play it... but i figure if you don’t ask.. 
 Anyway... 
 Toys  – like I said i like plugs but id be happy to do the same with  a little vibe.. make you  take it and leave it in to warm you up and get you wet. Or maybe it’s a remote vibe i can use as a reward for when your being good. I could make you practice sucking on a dildo, and fucking it too. Have you bouncing up and down on a rubbery cock while i watch or while you suck me. 
 Bondage  – lots of possibilities depends on what you would like.. I could tie you sitting down on one of the kitchen chairs. A little vibe in your pussy and your hands tied behind you to pushing your chest out. I could tickle teas grope abuse and appreciate your lovely perky breasts as you try to ignore the warm buzzingin your crotch. 
 Or i could strip you naked and wrap you up in cling film, hands by your side legs together. Wrapped up like a parcel but still on show. Maybe slip a vibe in and lay you down on my bed while i watch a film.  Coming over to make you suck me during the adverts. Once the film was finished I could just tear a hole in the cling film, take out your  vibe and slip right into your now soaking and still helpless pussy.  
 Or maybe i could tie you up in bondage that leaves  your arms  and legs free(not sure what its called but your tits, hips and torso would be bound and you would have a rope between your legs adn up between your ass cheeks, keeping a toy or plug in.) I’d put you in a nice light summer dress (make you look like a sweet little angel) and send you to the shops to buy something for me to fuck you with later...(its so hard to find small bananas these days :P ) 
 Spanking  – this is mostly because im an ass man, but as I said I like to watch a girl squrm and if she’s draped ove my knee and taking a spanking for being “bold” then that’s fine with me.. don’t like to hurt you too much but this is always fun.. more fun if your stuffed with a larg dildo.. or laying on your tummy on your bed, elbos resting on the edge of the bed my cock in your mouth sucking as i lean over and redden your heiny. 
 Dress up / Hypnosis  – again this is probably a bit strange but. I could hypnotise you into thinking you were wearing clothes when you were actually naked.. and then just watch you do your chores. Or I could have hypnotised you to make you go commando (or put on your little skimpy thong)  whenever mums not home.. makes for easy access. 
 Or i could have bought you some skimpy slutty clothes(something like this  we could add the plug later ) and hypnotised you into believing you have owned them all along. Maybe you get urges to try them on when it’s just the 2 of us at home.. or maybe you put them on and think nothing of it till I’m groping and enjoying what’s on show. 
 Or i could get you a present of a new costume.. a tight cat suit.. a French maids outfit.. some lingerie.. o show it to you and you say no.. but when i head out and you have the house to yourself to decide to try it on.. i come back and “catch” you wearing it and make you wear it for the evening as punishment... and if you were in a skimpy outfit.. it would be hard not to appreciate and enjoy your sexy body :P 
 I dont like pain blood poop or pee... 
 So pm me. please don’t just say “Hi”. Give me an idea of what you like. Would love to hear about your kinks and any other ideas you have..what else could a pervy brother do to his lovable obedient little sister? 
 And it's  not necessary but i do like to know your a girl.. so some form of proof maybe a pic of your nice girly hands or some frilly knickers  with verification or even just a recording of your voice saying your reddit name... you dont have to im not expecting it it would just be a plus.

"Finding this subreddit has changed my life, and I'm so sorry about the word-vomit below. Writing about my situation to people who might actually understand is such a liberating thing, I just want to give all the context I have on the chance some perfect stranger can relate. I'm riddled with self-loathing in general and although I'm slowly learning how to like myself it is so, so hard. I've been staring at this screen for 45 minutes, scared to even post in case someone responds to this with ""You're a fucking idiot. You're the problem.""  But maybe that's why I need to... Because I've stopped feeling like I'm worthy of support. 
 I live with my dysfunctional, emotionally abusive family who have seen me devolve from a confident, enthusiastic person into a self-critical, anxious mess who has to see her shrink on the sly because they judge everything about me and get into my head about everything. Not telling them about my psychiatric care (which they wouldn't approve of) is the biggest rebellion I have ever done, but I'm not prepared to compromise. 
 Not long ago, I finally got the guts to leave this household because I knew I didn't like the dread that came with going home at the end of the day, which features my Nmom, enabler Dad, golden child older brother and bratty (much younger) teen sister to move in with some ""friends"".  Turned out I knew how to pick 'em: the ""friends"" I moved in with conned me for money, berated me for not being ""fun enough"" and guilted me into cooking and cleaning for them.  It didn't take long for me to go from ""HOLY SHIT! FREEDOM! I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!"" to becoming severely anxious and depressed and not feeling comfortable leaving my room because they made a point of making me feel utterly unwelcome - and I was paying for the damn privilege! 
 My charismatic, warm family begged me to come home with open arms... And (cringe) seeing this as their desire to treat me better and respect me more, I came back. So fucking naive. 
 It's been 3 months since I've returned home. Daily I am disparaged with some cruel character of life-choice assessment: my major wasn't a field they approved of (even though I'm the first person in our extended family of this generation to go to university and it had great career prospects), my desire to go to Grad school in that field was similarly judged, my desire not to do Grad school after some serious thought made me a ""quitter"", my anxiety is ""not real"" (because Nmom is a social worker and knows what ""real"" anxiety looks like), my character is ""judgemental and self-important"" (even though most of my anxiety derives from a deep fear of disappointing anyone), my loving, healthy relationship of 4 years is me ""taking myself too seriously"" and they don't like my wonderful partner because they think he ""looks down on them"" (though they've stopped making any effort to make him feel welcome), getting a reputable good job within 2 weeks of graduating was sneered at because my family don't ""like the industry"" I joined, my promotion after only six months there & the promise of another promotion in a few months' time was no good because I don't ""make enough money""... Now I'm paying board because apparently I make ""too much money"" to not give something back. Oh, and I ""worry about money too much."" I don't mind paying them for the roof over my head, but the hypocrisy that comes it all is unreal. 
 Talking reason into them is not an option. The conflict style of the whole family is to scream loudest and longest. I am called on to mediate the fights of others, but if I clash with anyone, it's instantly my fault and I can't scream anyone down, though I'm constantly told I'm the one exacerbating the fights and making it worse when I try to say my side. My SO has finally admitted to me that for the last several years together, it's been hard for him to watch me gaze after them longingly like an abused puppy, hoping for some scraps of affection or pride in me. He said as far as he's concerned, they're abusive towards me, and only me. Pillars of the community to everyone else... sound familiar? 
 My SO lives 3 hours away in a small town with no prospects for me and commuting to my workplace daily from there would be more stress than I can bear, so living with him is not an option. I'm gun-shy about shared living now, and I live in the most expensive city in my country to rent alone.  I'm making alright money at the moment, which has allowed me to to start saving up for two things I've always wanted: a house (the dream of which is to rent out for a while, then move into it with my SO) and the ultimate trip, the kind that starts with a one-way plane ticket and a vague idea of where to go and only a shrug as to when I'll return. 
 Frankly, I don't care which life-victory comes first, but either way it will be a while before I'm out of the family home. My question is this: how do you live in an environment like this and ""rise above it"", so to speak? All I need is the fortitude to keep them from crawling under my skin, but I don't know how to do that. I was raised to have no barriers around people (go figure) and putting up defenses now is not something that comes naturally to me. But I'm not meant to be an anxious person. I'm a bubbly, warm, sociable person who will give anyone a chance. I know if I can just get out without fearing that I'll have to come back, I'll be that person again.

"The Most Embarrassing Story Ever. (true story) 
 When I was 16 my girlfriend at the time was finally ready to have sex. I, as one might expect of a 16 year old, was excited. Neither hell nor high water was going to stand between me and my final destination. 
 I get ready for the night, trim everything up, shower extra well. Unfortunately there was also an issue. I have a intestinal disorder that sometimes cause my shit to become large and quite solid while still inside me. I wasn't aware it was a treatable problem and, in fact, just thought everyone had to deal with the equivalent of anal kidney stones. I bring this up because I had a mighty one which had been loaded into the gun for several days. 
 Let me set the scene. Her parents are away. We have her house to ourselves. She was always a little kinky so she demands we do it in her parents bed. I walk in to a candle holocaust. She's been working on this all day apparently, and its as bright as high noon in there with the lights off. Which is good, because she proceeds to do a sweet, sexy little dance for me. At 16, she was AMAZING. For those of you who never experienced a female at that age, I pity the fool. 
 Now I'm sitting on the bed, watching this dance. I smile and tell her how good she looks. Unfortunately, most of my attention is focused on the dull throbbing from my sphincter and the large amount of intestinal discomfort associated with not dropping deuce in days. But somehow I still get hard and we go to town. She starts out on top, then we switch. I bend her over the bed, and I even smack her ass (a ballsy move at the time, but she loved it). Due to my built up distraction, I last for what seems like FOREVER. She can't stop moaning and telling me how good it feels, and then she says what every man wants to hear ""I want to make you cum in my mouth."" I fucking love women. 
 So she goes down on me. She was always average at best in the head department but at least she tried. She pops my cock out of her mouth long enough to look up at me and say ""tell me if you like this"". Then I feel it.
She stuck her finger up my ass. 
 My brain hits the panic switch and every muscle in my entire body locks up tighter than a three year old virgin. But its too late.
I take a massive, PAINFUL, PAINFUL shit, all over her parents comforter. No, you aren't understanding. I mean large. Huge. IMMENSE. Take your largest shit and multiple it by forty-two and you'll have an idea of what flew out of me. And gents, when I say flew, I don't mean ""I pooped."" I mean ""projectile"". I mean ""hurricane force winds hitting an umbrella stand"". And due to my condition, it comes out as a large, dark brown, smelly harpoon. 
 I know it hit her. I didn't see it. She ran screaming ""OH MY GOD OHMYGODOHMYGODEEEEEWWWWWWWW"" but I always imagined that, due to her position, it hit her right in the chin. Or at least the tits. I would like to say I got up to go after her. But I heard the bathroom door shut and I just lied there. The smell hit me after a few seconds. It smelled like someone rolled a cat in shit and threw it into a tire fire. I looked down and saw, to date, the largest bowel movement I've ever heard of laying on the bed. Then I noticed the blood, and when I did, I noticed the pain. 
 Apparently the fact that it was so large caused it to rip my ass a little bit (thought I was bleeding from the inside. This little doctors trip the next day is what taught me of my condition). There was a small pool of blood where my ass had been. A final reminder of the exact place and moment I lost my virginity. I will treasure this memory for all my days. 
 I grab my shit with my hands and go to the downstairs bathroom. I throw around 1/3 into the toilet and flush, fearing any more will clog it and only add to my already significant woes. I stand there, holding 2/3's of my biggest shit of all time, feeling a trickle of blood flow down my leg, trying to ignore the sharp pain stabbing my rectum. I find myself wishing I had a photo of this. 
 Anyway, I finish flushing my baby, clean off my hands, jam toilet paper between my cheeks (I skipped the band-aid) and went upstairs. I could hear my girlfriend sobbing from behind the bathroom door. I decided not to say anything to her and just keep moving. The smell in her parents room was abysmal. Its like when you take a shit and walk out of the bathroom you think ""hey not so bad today,"" but then you walk back in to grab your magazine and go ""HOLY SHIT!"". It was one of those moments. 
 The scene is burned behind my eyelids for all time. My life. My shame. My very first time smelled like a pile of dead babies. I quickly got dressed since the heat from ten thousand candles was making the room feel more like a port-a-potty. I was aware enough to grab the comforter on my way out and drag it downstairs to their washer. Also the top and bottom sheets since the blood had leaked on through all the way to mattress. Still no sign of the GF but at this point I considered it a blessing. 
 I jammed in the washer with 3 loads worth of detergent and set it on spin, knowing that not even the hand of God would save these linens, let alone Tide and Snuggles. Then I left. I avoided my GF's calls for days until she came to my house. We had a long talk about what happened. Talk being synonymous with ""breaking up with me because I shit on her"". And it was all over. She promised not to tell a soul and I don't THINK she ever did. She was probably as ashamed as I was about the whole deed. But I will always this happening as the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me.

"You're going to OD again and die. 
 Your father will blame himself for wanting to kick you out. He'll show it however wanting to stay strong for the family and instead try and simply state that there was nothing he could have done. It'll tear him up inside. 
 Your mother will be destroyed. She'll feel it was her fault. She'll blame your father however though because to her, he forced you away. She'll need someone to blame and since she can not always blame herself (she'll save that when she's alone on the bathroom floor crying and throwing up) she'll blame your father. She'll hate him and her herself for not doing more. 
 Your siblings will be caught in the middle of a worse fight than before. Only this time they'll feel guilt too, because they couldn't help, and they can't stop their parents from fighting. Then they'll question if their parents love them as much as they loved you because they're fighting because of you but not working it out because of them. They'll then divide their time hating you, hating the drugs, and hating their parents for ignoring the rest of the family. 
 In the end your parents will divorce. Your mom will shut off from the other kids because she won't want to be hurt again and will think theirs no point. She loved and fought for you - and look where that got her and you. Your father will try to find something else to take his mind off of the situation. Whether that's a bottle, his work, or a new family. You'll have robbed your other siblings of a normal family life and that will have a house of cards effect on whether or not they want to have kids. Or be in a serious relationship, since their parents only ended up fighting and arguing about their son. To avoid that they'll question having kids, and a family of their own. 
 In the end you'll have only helped one person, yourself. Through your selfish ignorance of choosing to numb the pain rather then get help, because it's easier that way, you'll be dead and unable to see the people who loved you most self destruct. You selfish piece of shit. 
 You're going to continue sticking that needle in your arm. Draining everything that matters, all at the cost of not feeling anything for a few hours. You're too afraid to fight for your life because you see no worth to your life. Yet all the proof of its worth is what you just left behind. 
 You'd rather shoot up all the money you have and will ever have because in your head 20-40 bucks a day for drugs a day is better than using that money to instead get help. 
 You need to hit rock bottom. You're too lazy and stupid to realize what you have. You have no illness debilitating your body. You have the usage of your limbs. You would probably be a healthy young guy if it weren't for all the drugs in your system. However because you'd rather let your mental illness control your life - you'll fall into a syringe every time. 
 See a doctor. See a therapist. Go to a free clinic, call the suicide prevention hotline in your area. If those are too hard for you, break a banks window with some dope on you and wait for the cops. Let them cart you off and you can go through withdraw at the bottom of a cell. Maybe then you'll wake up and get the help you need. 
 This story is sad. Not because I feel bad for you, but because there are so many people out there who could only wish to have a family that loved them enough to fight for them. Or a body to shoot dope into. Or the motor skills to hold a fucking needle on their own. Or the mental capacity to read Reddit in the first place. But instead, you're going to waste the little life and opportunity to experience that life,  by getting stoned.  Because feeling numb for an hour is better than feeling all the other emotions. 
 Fuck you OP.  You're selfish and pathetic. All these other Redditors think talking to you rationally will help, but it won't. Because you're too stupid to realize what you have and fight for it. You'd rather run into the golden brown then fucking live. You'd rather run away from your problems to 'save them' from you because you're too ignorant to see that, that only saves you from having to watch you hurt them. Now they can be safely out of sight and mind while you shoot up. 
 You're selfish. I can see why you try to escape with the needle. It's too hard to get better when your enemy is yourself. And despite all these people on the Internet and in your life telling you different, you think you're too weak to fight for your own life. 
 You aren't though. Get help. Don't ruin your families life by ending yours. You're only taking all the pain you feel and putting it onto the people who care about you. Get help. Call the police. Call the suicide prevention. Call rehab. Go to the hospital. Fucking live asshole. You don't have to do it for yourself at the start. Do it for them at the start, and when you take a step backward as all addicts do, use them as the inspiration to stop again, until finally you don't step backwards. And I guarantee you'll wake up one day and realize you're doing it for yourself as well by not using. But you can't get there until you start. So fucking call, go, talk to someone. Shit - go home to your parents and ask them to help. They will have advice. I guarantee money is less important then you are. They were willing to sacrifice their marriage for you after all. 
 Your Dad loves you. He just doesn't want you to die in his house and doesn't see any other way. GET HELP. Stop with the excuses and get it. Fucking live and stop numbing the pain. Pain helps make you realize you're alive. And life is that much better when you've made it out the other side and discover what it's like without pain. Get help man.",5698,Fuck you OP.

"1:32 PST: My guy left, so looking again.. hornier than before 
 Okay this is weird, I know. No one is forcing you to help me. 
 I’m completely, insanely in love with my ex. And he knows it, and uses it pretty much to control me. I know I’m not the only one, either. He’s kind of a demon – in fact, “Demon” is Damon’s nickname – and he keeps me as part of what he calls a “Harem.” 
 Doesn’t matter, I love him. And so would you, as straight as you are. He’s what you fucking wish you were, lonely DPP guys. He’s tall, blond (although he usually dyes his hair some crazy color or five), ripped, rich, hung, and unlike most guys like that? He actually has sex appeal instead of some douche personality. He does whatever it takes to get a girl off. And I know that’s what you want to be. So be that with me? 
 I want to pretend to be texting him. That’s how it always starts. He sends a text. Starts off a little romantic, a little crude. And he knows… how to get to me. Somehow, I always end up over at his place. 
 I’m fucking ashamed of how quickly he gets me naked. Once he managed to strip me while his front door was still open, by kissing my neck and telling me how much he missed me, how hard it is to find anyone who will put up with his shit like I do. Etc. Ex-boyfriend stuff. Stuff I need. Crave. Fucking  feed on . 
 Then he sits me in his lap, facing him, cock under my pussy (and my ass, and past it). He tells me I need to eat more because I’m too light (but he smirks in a way that reminds me just how obsessed he is with skinny girls). He flaunts his single-digit bodyfat percentage, tells me how much money he made that week, how he fucked an underage girl without a condom and oh yeah by the way she was a virgin, whatever. He knows I have a sneaker fetish, he wears his best skate shoes, somehow always manages to match mine. He’s reverse racist (I’m Asian and he’s obsessed with Asian girls). Sometimes he just tells me over and over how much he’s always loved me, how I’m the only girl he gets emotional with. 
 Sometimes he tears up while he’s telling me romantic shit, even if he’s banging the shit out of me and I can barely hear him over the sound of his crazy-muscled legs beating the shit out of my thighs. Once he fucked me on a scale, just babbling to himself about how hot it was that I’m only about 100 pounds, while at the same time accidently getting me off on how heavy he is from working out. Once he stuffed my head into a pillowcase full of new twenties And tied it around my neck so pretty much the only sensation I had was money – feel, smell, even taste – and his cock and body. Crazy shit. 
 Crazy shit that is weirdly and hugely hot in a way that sane hotness never really is, and that gets me (and others, I know because he makes SURE I know, and forces me to get off on it, too) to cum as hard as I ever could if I lived to be a million years old. He’s the God you pray to every time you’re inside a girl and you’re begging the universe to bring her off before you cum. When you open DPP? God you talk to when you want to find the perfect girl to get you off. When you say, “God, yes” when you’re fucking? Or your girl does? Guess who? Yeah, him. Demon. My ex. 
 So weird or not, this is what both of us want. You want to be him, I want you to be him. Help me? 
 Details to help. Like I said I’m Asian. I’m about a foot shorter than him, but he’s 6’5 and insanely proud of it. I’m 105 atm, maybe 2 pounds heavier than normal but it was a rough weekend. I have a deep pussy for a small girl, and it’s pretty much molded to his cock, which is another thing that really gets him off. Ruining me for other guys. He’s territorial as hell. I told you already that I have a sneaker fetish, and I’m ashamed of it but he isn’t, and loves to just tear me open. I cry easily. Neither of us eats meat (except his cock, obviously). I love being held up when he eats me, anything that gets me high up in the air. 
 If you’re good? Nonsexual stuff: we’ve done a shitload of air stuff. Hangliding. Planes. Skydiving. Mountain Climbing. He knows I love altitude. My family is half Korean half Japanese. He can speak both languages and I can’t, which amuses the shit out of him. He calls me “Angel,” he calls himself “Demon.” I never do until he makes me. He loves to make me say things. Like how much I love him. He drives a heavily customized Accord, not a Ferrari or anything, and his apartment is pretty much empty. He likes people, not stuff he says. We dated all through high school. He cheated like a million times, but never hid it so I don’t even know if that counts as cheating. He doesn’t think so. We met skating. He still has (a very expensive) deck. He’s also 20, nearly got kicked out from not studying (boredom, not stupidity), and I graduated in the top 50. Private school. He was a bully. He’s still a bully, kind of, just only with guys and only when he’s disgusted by weakness. In a pinch he will fuck anything (female) that moves, but he never has to settle and is proud that he never jerks off or even (so he says) hold his cock when he takes a piss (he’s had me do that for him, I assume there’re others). He’s as crazy as I am, just in a different way. Ask me whatever else you need to know. 
 Please, PLEASE help me. I literally cannot get off without thinking about him anyway. I know he reads Reddit. There’s no way in hell he’d bother with DPP, but I like the idea that he’d read this. I’ve certainly given enough detail for him to recognize me. He has friends who probably hang out here, maybe they’ll send him the link. (Just please don’t post it to Facebook.) However you like. But you’re not you, you’re him, unless you’re asking questions, and you can probably disguise those as “him” too, if you know what you’re doing.",5777,"text wall from crazy as shit girl in love with ex boyfriend, I guess read most of it if you want in?

"I've shit in a urinal and this is my story.  No Throwaway required becasue this is a story I tell frequently. 
 So the setting is five years ago in Australia.  I'm an adult, married, kids, Job, ordinary boring, human being.  What I have that makes me less than ordinary is I have three asshole friends. 
 We were coming back from a movie Premiere.  I forget which one, and the distance between my home (and my friends town) is about 2 and a half hours at 100km's an hour.  So It's late and we all ate fast food crap before the movie, it was a long movie so the Cinema was closed and mostly locked when we walk out there. The toilets were all locked and such, with only one staff member on. 
 We get out and head to the car and start the long drive home, chatting about the movie the implications of said movie blah blah blah.  There are long distances of nothing and the occasional tiny service town that close up at 8 pm dotting the landscape of where I'm driving.  I pass the last tiny town (No toilets) and there is twenty minutes till the next town.  That is when the caffeine starts to work it's magic relaxing my sphincters like a siren calling to a lovelorn sailor.  I move in to full clench mode, gripping the steering wheel and locking my legs.  I tell my friends that no matter what, first stop in the next big town is a toilet, and here is where I made my first mistake.  I let them know how desperate and dire the situation was.  My three asshole friends hatch a plan texting each other so as to keep me in the dark about the horrible game of keep away they were going to enact. 
 We pull in to a 24 hour gas station and it's deserted because it's midnight.  I jump out of the car, and two of the guys dawdle a bit.  It's in a bad neighborhood so I really want to lock my car.  The last guy gets out shuts the door, and asshole A and asshole B have made it to this security gate and opened it and are holding it for me.  Asshole C is the one holding me back by taking his time.  I lock the car and make for the gate to the toilet block. As soon as I get to the gate they let it swing so I catch it and asshole A and B proceed the five metres to the toilet block.  I catch up and enter the bathroom only to see the last of two stalls doors close and lock.  I reiterate the urgency and Asshole A says he's taking a piss so he'll be only a minute.  I can wait that long so I'm cool with it but I know that the poop train is coming and there are no brakes. 
 What happens next is a marvel of Choreography that I never expected, otherwise I would have taken other precautions.  Asshole A and B take their time, asshole C waits just outside the bathroom for a text message.  I'm pacing and clenching as best I could, I only have to wait a little while longer even though I'm starting to yield ground I know I can make it.   Asshole C moves into the bathroom as I pace out to the sinks, and while my back is turned asshole A and C swap into and out of the free stall without flushing.  The first I know of this is as Asshole A approaches me at the sink, which I am now gripping and holding on for dear life.  I look up relieved and rush into the room, and I am prepared to unleash my cargo only to be greeted by two closed doors and some laughter from all three assholes and I know in that second my time is up.  I know I can't make it the twenty metres to the female bathroom, my only options were a flimsy wastepaper basket, a barely attached to the wall sink or the half wall stainless steel urinal. 
 Tears in my eyes from the strain, I unbuckle, flush the wall urinal so it's cleaner than it was, drop my pants and rest awkwardly up against the steel.  Buttcheeks to metal, legs skewed at odd angles, half standing half crouching I make my final stand and Let it go.   The laughter stops as soon as they hear what drastic measures I've had to take.  The only other option would have been to shit myself and I wasn't prepared to let that happen.  As it was unbeknownst to me at the time my boxers have already been damaged beyond repair from the attempted holding back of the poop train. 
 Wide eyed two of the Assholes open both stalls at the same time.  Asshole A comes in from the sinks to witness my destroying of the urinal, Asshole B and C emerge shock on their faces as I am mid Dropping trough in the trough. 
 They start gagging.  It's an impressive smell, and they move straight to helping me out of this mess they've helped put me into by heading out and keeping watch.  I make my way to a free toilet and finish and clean up as best I can as well as inspect the damage.  My pants themselves are mercifully fine, my boxers unfortunately are not, as they had rested into a half full of piss, floor urinal. 
 I disentangle my boxers without ruining my pants and finish the personal inspection before moving on to dealing with the bigger problem. I proceed to look at the mess I've created stunned at it's volume and steel myself for what has to be done next.  There was no way I was going to leave a heinous mess like this for some poor minimum wage night shift employee to clean up, because that would be adding insult to injury. 
 Thankfully the bathroom has been recently stocked with heavy duty paper towels, and I start lifting as much shit out of the urinal onto a barge of poop and paper and I start to ferry it to the unoccupied toilet.  It takes four trips but by then end, and after much flushing of the wall urinal, I get it to a point where it only smells like someone took a horrid shit into it, no visible sign of shit anywhere. 
 I dispose of my waste laden boxers, scrub myself to my elbows in the sink.  Let Asshole A, B and C know that it was safe to come in and then I make my way to the car, to book it out of the truck-stop gas station as fast as my car will carry me, despite what they had done to me, friends in tow. 
 Afterwards on the continuing journey home (we still had an hour and a half to go) all three friends admit none of them needed to use the toilet, they were just texting each other about how funny this was, all felt guilty and rightly so that they put me in a shitty situation.",6135,"Caffeine powered turd train with no brakes assails my pants, asshole friends play a game of crossing cups with the only available and reachable in time toilets at a gas station.

"EDIT:  Apparently my update is horrendously offensive to some people, so I want to warn all those who find self-deprecating humor absolutely abhorrent, to move along, you're not going to like anything that happens below. 
 Sorry to anyone I've offended with my story. I don't fully understand it, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I thank you for sharing yours, whether positive or negative. 
 [ORIGINAL POST]( 
 [UPDATE PART 1]( 
 Okay, final update. 
 Unfortunately this is all rather anti-climatic. I’m sure you all were hoping for a dramatic reconciliation complete with fireworks, maybe a love parade, and/or making out in the rain. But I live in southern California and it doesn’t rain here during the summer. It’s dry and dusty as shit, and ironically,  SO IS MY FORMER RELATIONSHIP! 
 Soooooo, I last left off after I had sent my ex-bf an email back to his email, where I went all crazy girl dramatic, told logic and reason to go fuck themselves, and basically wrote him several pages of nonsense on a similar level as this shit: 
 “I DON’T UNDERSTAND EX-BOYFRIEND?!? WHY DON’T YOU LOVE LIKE HOW YOU USED TO LOVE ME?!? DON’T YOU REALIZE THAT WE’RE LIVING THE REAL LIFE VERSION OF THE NOTEBOOK AND YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BUILD ME A HOUSE AND ROOM WHERE I CAN PAINT LANDSCAPES NAKED AND THEN READ MY DIARY BACK TO ME WHEN WE’RE 90 BECAUSE MY ALZHEIMER'S WILL HAVE ERASED MY MEMORY AND THE STORY OF OUR STORY WILL BE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TRIGGER A FEW MINUTES OF LUCIDITY, IN WHICH I’LL REMEMBER EVERYTHING AND IT WILL BE A MAGICAL CLIMACTIC APEX MOMENT OF OUR ETERNAL AND UNDYING LOVE!?!?!… HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT THAT?!?… ” 
 I guess that’s technically a  “spoiler”  summation of the actual  “Notebook”  film, but that shit has been out for 10 years, so if you haven’t seen it yet and I just spoiled it for you,  TOO FUCKING BAD YOU LAZY, NON-MOVIE WATCHING BUTTFACE! 
 I’m sorry… I didn’t meant that. You’re not a buttface. 
 Anyway… The day after I wrote that email, I totally wished I hadn’t. I typed it out and sent it very hastily and, had I waited a mere 24 hours, I would have realized that nothing I said back to him really mattered. It didn’t matter if he was lying to himself or not. It didn’t matter if he agreed with me or not. It didn’t matter if he was really hiding from his feelings and pushing everything away because he’s an emotional deflector. 
 The point is, it takes  TWO  people to want something to work, and he’s just not ready or willing to open that can of worms with me again… no matter how casual and free-spirited my fantasy version of our relationship was going to be. 
 He responded  FIVE FUCKING DAYS LATER,  with about 4 sentences basically saying (again, not actually his words, but my artistic paraphrased interpretation of them): 
 “Hey ex-girlfriend, let me explain  AGAIN.  Breaking-up was  EXTREMELY  hard for me. One of the hardest things I've ever gone through  (puuuussssssy)  and all of the feelings and love I have for you is still there and still very raw. I can’t emotionally handle kissing you, and making love to you  (he actually used the phrase “making-love” O__O)  in a casual way. I wouldn’t be able to handle that at all. I’m sorry, but I don’t know what else to say... 
 I guess your vagina is just too amazing for me to only have some of the time. It’s basically heroin and  I DON’T WANT TO BE ADDICTED TO YOUR AWESOMENESS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I’M TRYING OUT OTHER “DRUGS” (cough-VAGINAS-cough) AND WHILE THEY’RE NOT AS GOOD AS YOURS, I HAVE DECIDED TO TRY OUT A LIFE OF MEDIOCRITY WITH GIRLS LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN YOU FOR THE TIME BEING. SORRY FOR BEING SO DISAPPOINTING. I’LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I GROW SOME BALLS.  I’m still in love with you too and I think i always will be  (<—— actually said that last part verbatim). ” 
 Okay, that was a little harsh. I’m just venting my frustration while attempting to be funny, because laughing at yourself is better than crying... I think... 
 Now, as you might recall, the last time he sent an email back, I  IMMEDIATELY  responded with a nice big firestorm of crazy. 
 So I am  VERY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE  that I put a chokehold on my own personal insanity, and did not, I repeat,  DID NOT,  send a response! I didn’t call, I didn’t text, I didn’t do anything at all! 
 It was not easy mind you. I wrote several dozen email responses in my head… and I desperately wanted to type them out… all of them… and compile them into one  MASSIVE,  20 page email… and then send it… and then be like,  “what now motherfucker?!?… how could you possibly NOT want me now? After I’ve articulated myself with such passionate, intense dedication to my obsessive thought process?!?” 
 So instead, I listened to Elliott Smith for a while, and then played my guitar a bunch and wrote 2 sad-ish songs that I actually think Elliott would have totally liked, or at least been like,  “that doesn’t suck too bad.” 
 After all of this, I honestly feel better about everything. I realized that the feelings I had been building up were based on a fantasy of something that didn’t exist. I feel like I have some closure and am no longer inflating or romanticizing this person like I had been. 
 In a way, the whole thing seems completely silly now. I’m not going to respond to his email either. I’m simply going to leave it all be for now and let the air clear. We’ll be close friends again eventually, but for now, the dust needs to settle, and I need to process and work through the rest of these feelings... 
 Which, based on this weekends adventures in artistic self-expression, could very likely result in a self-produced acoustic EP of angsty emo indie-rock; a combination of,  Blink-182-throwing-up-all-over-Dashboard-Confessional-while-Alanis-Morissette-stomps-in-the-vomit-puddles-which-are-shaped-liked-Kurt-Cobains-face,  kind of soundscape! 
 Something I can be sure to feel embarrassed about for years to come! 
 I want to thank everybody that left me comments, offered support, gave advice, negative and positive. I really appreciate all of you who took the time to respond and help me see things more clearly. It really made a difference to me, and I can’t thank you all enough for just being awesome humans to an internet stranger. <3",6238,"Wrote ex-bf an email telling him I was still in love with him.

"I originally posted this as a comment, but after reading countless comments on the advice mallard thread, I realize lots of guys really are clueless about how you should deal with this. I spent so much time writing this down I might as well publish it here, if it's bad and I should feel bad well so be it but I think this might really be helpfull to some people, so here it is ,How to make good cunnilingus by Me, oral enthusiast and dedicated pussy liker 
 First , you need to master three different simple moves :
1 - The most basic is of course, up and down, right to left. This is what makes the magic happen. Not much to say about this, that's what we all instinctively do. 
 2 - Circles. This move is very useful for a particular reason : I noticed that going straight to the clit can be kinda painfull at first for the girl, it's too sensitive sometimes and you need to warm it up. so you'll need the circle move, that allows you to stimulate around the clitoris. Imagine that it's like when a girl gently slide her hand up and down your cock before blowing you, it does not feel particulary awesome, but it get's you hard and waiting for the real deal. 
 3 - Suck. Yes, suck. The sucking adds variety to what is happening to her clit, I guess it drives blood into it, and such things... but this move is important because it allows you to rest your tongue, it gives you this 1 or 2 seconds break you need, plus she'll want you to start licking again, while still feeling stuff. 
 So you tried those three moves while reading this and it's pretty simple, now what ?
Don't go straight to the mofuckin' clit. Never. Have you ever had an inexperienced girl go ham on your cock like she's Sasha Grey ? That doesn't feel very good, does it ? It's too sudden, too fast, it takes all the fun out of getting a blowjob. Well, for girls, it's even more important to really build things up, because it's not really about how much they are stimulated, it's about how much they are aroused. So what you need to do, is take your time to get where she knows you're going. Caress her legs, her ass, her pussy without opening it up and sticking a finger in it, kiss her tits, her belly etc... while you slowly go down there. At this point, she should be getting hot, she's expecting your tongue in her pussy at any moment but doesn't really know when, and it drives her mad in a good way. 
 Then you finally stick your tongue in. I'm not going to explain how to find the clit or whatever I'm going to assume you've had a little sex ed in your life and will be able to find your way. Make sure the lips are spread apart, so you've got enough room to operate. Again, you need to warm her up, and the best way to do that is to make sure she experiences a wide range of pleasurable feelings, and a little frustration too. So you gently but firmly explore her pussy with your tongue, the inner lips are not very sensitive, nor is the entry to the vagina, but still make her feel your tongue there and there, mess around. Then, focus more (but not only) on the more interesting parts : circle the clit and go up and down in this kinda flat area beetween the clit and the vag. You can start to lick the clit too, but don't rush things up, be gentle and soft. 
 So this was the two parts of the warm up. She should start to enjoy herself, moan a little etc... The thing is, you really don't know if she's already warmed up enough, and want you to really get started, or if she wants you to keep this pace for a little more time. Well, my friend, you have to guess this by how she reacts. Let's say she's ready for you to really give her pleasure. Now you can lick the clit up and down, but not too fast ! Lick the whole area between her vag and the top of her clit, so each stroke starts and end on a part not too sensitive but always stimulate her clit. Accelerate your pace, but keep doing other stuff. Try things. Stimulates the upper part of the clit, which is under some kind of ""hood"" with a left and right movement, suck on that clit, stick your tongue in her vag... Keep accelerating your pace slowly as her pleasure builds up, apply more pressure etc... At some point you'll realize it's probably a matter of really short minutes, even maybe seconds before she comes, so then and only then start to really go nuts on the clit, do wide, strong movements and short rapid licks, suck on it strongly when your tongue starts to hurt... when she starts to cum, and you'll notice, just focus on that clit for a final rush, but at the end, when she's at the very climax, just suck on it strongly, and then release it. It's probably getting too sensitive for direct stimulation, so sucking on it is the best option for the grande finale. 
 Now there is a few things that are absolutely essential that I have to add. First, get to learn every girl you go down on. Some things that work with a girl, might not work with another, see how she reacts to what you do and adapt. TALK TO HER. There's nothing shameful about asking what was good and what was bad, communication is the key to all relationships. Secondly, but it should have been first, be sensual. Listen to the girl's body, try to feel it, take pleasure from what you're doing, make her feel that you're into her, even if going down on a girl is not particularly something you like. In one word : be fuckin passionate about it ! This means use your damn hands. Keep caressing her, more and more firmly as it gets more intense, grab her, push her towards you, look her in the eyes. It should not be just a tongue on her clit, it should be a man (or a girl, I don't care, but I'm sure lesbians don't really need this kind of advice) making love with her with his mouth. She has to feel that, between her legs, there's this awesome guy which is completly into what he is doing. Finally, don't focus only on making her cum focus on what your are doing at the very moment you are doing it so it is the most enjoyable, and don't apply these advices as a recipe. Rely on what you feel, use the force ! 
 How to get bonus points : put some Marvin Gaye on, make sure she's not cold if she's naked, make her comfortable, let her rest a little while cuddling her when it's over even if you're going to bang right after that",6253,"Read the whole damned thing for fucks sake, this post is a masterpiece :( 
 Sources : Nina Hartley, Danny Brown, Plenty books about sex, My ex, Me. 
 EDIT : This post is going to be a collaborative post I think. I re-read it and there's two things I had to precise : 
 First : when I'm talking about the final rush, or going nuts on the clit don't take this too seriously. If you follow my advice, you've been pretty gentle from the begining, so going faster and stronger shouldn't mean going really crazy, the line between ""hm, harder, this feels so good"" and ""huh, it hurts"" is easy to cross. 
 Secondly : some people here wrote that they had some even better results when the slowed down at the very end. I think it's really interesting, and I'm going to try it ASAP, and you should too. 
 EDIT 2 : As some girls said, depending on whether or not the girl you're giving oral to likes penetration a lot, fingering her can be a great idea, or not so much. Again, get to know the girl so you know what she really likes. Here is, according to carolinared, how you should proceed : 
 >two fingers going slightly in and straight up in a come hither motion while the clit is getting some work done is fucking amazing. 
 Warning : I've heard that it might cause female ejaculation, which I personally wouldn't mind at all, but it might be a little surprising 
 EDIT 3 : Ok, so things are getting pretty serious right now, are you ready to step your game up FOR REAL ?
Here's a secret move I used to do but that I somehow forgot to mention and that a kind redditor reminded me of, upvote him its in the comments ! Here's the protip : when you suck on the clit, well, you can flick it with your tongue at the SAME DAMN TIME. As you can imagine, it works like a charm. Don't be too rough tho. 
 I must add another warning of top of that, some female redditors have told me that many women find direct stimulation of the clit to be hurtful. If you notice this (you should ask, it might seem like a weird question but it's always better to know before you get started) lick the clit from upwards, where there is a hood that protects it. A few millimeter up, you can feel the ""root"" of the clit, as I call it, which is a great place to be stimulated with a left to right movement according to my experience. 
 EDIT 4 : Ok, so, first ? Shout out to the guy or girl that gave me reddit gold, seriously pal that's awesome now I'm gonna be branded as a karma whore for the rest of my life on reddit but fuck it ! Feels good ! #1 of the Sex page ? More than 700 upvotes ? Common guys I barely had 700 karma points yesterday !! 
 Secondly, this text has received so much attention that I feel like I have to be even more clear on some points.
I made this because I realized some guys would probably bore they GF to death if they tried to perform oral on her, so it's kind of a ""how to"" manual wrote by a 19 yo who performed lots of oral on his longtime (ex) girlfriend. I still think this is great advice, but as some people here have pointed, some of the techniques shown here may be completely ineffective or even weird to some girls. I think I have to stress even more that EVERY GIRL is different, and that even if I praised a technique in this post, you should make sure it does work, and stop rightaway if it doesn't. Listen. To. Your. Partners. Body. 
 What is the most important in this post, and what you should remember, is not the moves, but how you should work on your timing, your pace, how you should make your partner feel, because what saddens me with a lot of men, is not that they do not have the right moves, but that they simply consider oral as basic ""let's get her wet"" foreplay and don't do it seriously. Do not be that guy that just puts his dick in her, be passionate, be dedicated, be willing to do your best !",3819,0.6919190287590027,0.9682009220123292,0.0127611346542835,0.0406459607183933,0.6770147681236267,0.9182500243186952,0.0037068587262183,0.0035891968291252,0.2050089687108993,0.4087186157703399,0.0107385348528623,0.0108710164204239,"Don't go straight to the mofuckin' clit.

"I [25F] am stuck. I've lost myself in the sea of all those around me. It is a problem that I have addressed in the past but this time is different. This time I am the grown up and I need to use the mouth that has had no problems spouting off when I needed it to before. 
 I  am  happily married to [30M], coming on year the 3rd. Okay, happliy as in I  am  happy. He makes me happy. He is my one. We have a toddler who is feral and full of life. I love that little boy more than words can describe. For those of you who are parents - you get it. For those of you who aren't I at least hope you ""get it"". 
 Somewhere since our engagement to now I have forgotten how to use my words. I used to be quite good with words. They once poured out of me like I had a silver tongue. Now - I don't know what in the actual fuck happened. I think I was too busy trying to show the world that I can do this adult thing without the aid of those cock sucking fuckholes, the monsters that plagued what used to be my reality. 
 My husband proposed to me in a big show-off kind of way, even though he knew I was not down with the whole public display thing. He also wasn't a fan of it, but my monsters dug their fucking claws in there and since he was still trying to win the affection that would never come he went along with this fucking plan. I was not impressed but I understood just how much courage it took for my husband to do what he did. I also appreciate his intent to mend my family - to show them I found a man who will treat me better then they ever would. 
 Then there was the wedding planning bullshit. I did not want a big wedding, and I did not get a big wedding although the monsters tried. I no longer speak to my monsters because I've had enough of their shit. 
 So to the courthouse we went. Between my immediate family (the not so crazy ones) and his immediate family there were too many people there for my liking. I got the fuck over that because I understand this is a big day for everybody there, not just my husband and I. It may have been our beginning but to them it was an end. I respect that and figured I would let them have a bit of a say since I am not a special event kind of gal. 
 I let my monster-in-law talk me into wearing a dress. Why? Because I'm a delusional idiot for thinking that was keeping the peace. I hate that fucking dress. It was on sale in the prom section at Sears for something like 60% off and because it was slightly damaged my MIL got another 20% taken off. She of course bought the dress. The cheap dress was not because of a financial issue but more of a surrender. I would get married in that fucking thing if it meant she'd shut her big trap about it. 
 So we say I do and we smooch and it's wonderful and I am Mrs. Charming. It's magical and fantastic and just fucking peachy. Well, Husband's Gma never got pictures taken with us in costume because my MIL is a bossy cunt and quite honestly everybody just wanted to get out of that room and away from her. 
 Fast forward a year and some and now I have a baby. I love him, I really do. My MIL decided she was his mother? Ha. Fuck that shit! I've had enough of this tom foolery but out of respect to my husband I say nothing. We had a deal - he will keep his crazy in line and I will do the same for mine. Except, my crazy isn't a burden since I've disowned all the toxic. Husband's crazy are wealthy and for some reason think that means they have a say in my life. 
 My crazy is wealthy too but their money is not worth my sanity. I wish my husband would take that same attitude with his crazy but he has some mommy issues that he refuses to admit that he has and so I just shut my own trap and wait for him to open up to me. 
 Well I've had just about enough. Now I feel like I can't say anything to him because we have hit that lovely part of our own relationship where the baby comes first. I am drag ass tired everyday. I have bags under my eyes that go down to my chin some days. I once cared about what I looked like but what's the point anymore? My husband fights with his mother over money all the time but no longer tells me about why he is so stressed becasue I have told him that I don't want to hear about the bullshit with his mother. 
 When I first realized how far into her pocket he was I threw a fit something fierce. I may be young and I may not have this life thing figured out but I have a good job and I'll be fucking damned if I have some millionaire on a powertrip  telling  me how the fuck to live my life. I want none of her money, none of her unsolicited help, and honestly just none of her. I'm so fucking tired of her shit and my husband knows it. He won't stop playing the game they play back and forth though. Again,  mommy issues . (I do not say that out of malace. Over the years of watching the two of them interact it is pretty obvious that he has some hurt he needs to get over before he can truly stand up to this woman.) 
 The only thing that gets fought about around here is - money. Why? Because we are fortunate enough not to have to worry about money. A-fucking-parently, this means lets fight about it constantly and loudly at every possible interaction. Are. You. Kidding me? 
 They got in a big screaming match the other week over money and when I went to leave them to their shit I saw in the corner of my eye, my toddler. Trapped in the corner by the front door with his back flat against the wall. Blocked by the MIL from hell and staring at Daddy with curiosity and fear. It was like in his face he knew Daddy would never hurt him but his voice was loud and scary like he had never heard before. 
 I tried to tell them to stop screaming at each other in an adult, cival voice but they were too loud to hear me so I managed to do with my voice something I had never thought I could. I bellowed at the pair of them. I told them they will not yell in front of my son. My husband's face was twisted between anger and shame. I knew I shouldn't have yelled at him like that but I was mostly doing it toward my MIL. Unfortunately he was letting her push all his buttons and lost his temper. 
 My MIL's face turned to victim and she may or may not have left our house crying. I really do not care because I am just so done with the bullshit that is her. I got a few messages from Husband's aunt about how I'm whatever demon spawn my MIL has painted me out to be and told her to get fucked too. 
 As far as I am concerned my husband's crazy can stay his crazy. That is not something I wish to share with him. I've had a lifetime of crazy and all I want is peace. I am not getting peace now though because my husband no longer wants to upset me with the hell that is his family and I can't talk to him about why it all bothers me.",6761,My husband isn't ready to detach from his controlling mother and it is having an effect on our relationship. I don't put my foot down out of respect for my  husband.

"Hello all, 
I'm so irritated with my boyfriend. We have been together for a little over a year and I am SO.TIRED.OF.HIS.SHIT. 
 Here is a list of some things I am super super incredibly sick of: 
 
 He smokes weed all day every day. 
 
 We're in college and he makes no effort with school which really really bothers me. We took a couple GE's together and I ALWAYS did his work for him. He has an internship at the school radio station and he has done literally NOTHING for it the entire semester. He doesn't put effort into anything! 
 
 He wants to be a stand-up comedian BUT HE ISN'T FUNNY AND I AM SO SICK OF ""LAUGHING"" AT HIS TERRIBLE JOKES. 
 
 He has some seriously family disfunction. His mom and dad got a divorce right before he went to college. His whole dad's side relies on guilt and manipulation to keep them together as a family. Once, his grandma told me I should ""read a book"" instead of watching trashy TV and he didn't even say anything. I can do both! 
 
 He is a big baby whiner and I have to mom him. 
 
 He's super irresponsible with money. Like, so irresponsible with it that he ran out of money so he just decided not to get me a birthday present. 
 
 He had a bad roommate situation happening earlier this year. I started to let him stay at my place and then everything just started to snowball. He literally moved in. He never looked for a new apartment. He just spent all his time bumming around my house, EVEN WHEN I WASN'T THERE. It took me getting like a serious talk from my roommates for him to realize that he miiiiight have overstepped some boundaries. In the three weeks since the talk he's, found a new apartment and moved there. WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE DONE THAT WAY EARLIER???? 
 
 For about a month, he refused to drive his car. He would only drive mine. I wouldn't let him drive if he was high so he would lie to me. I just found this out. HE FUCKING DROVE MY CAR WHILE HIGH AND LIED ABOUT IT. WHAT THE FUCK. 
 
 Whenever I ask him for space or say, I would really like some br0srsly time right now he like, loses his ability to be rational. He will cry and whine and beg and get upset and list reasons why I should just let him stay at my house 24/7. We have been having the same argument about this for weeks. I JUST LIKE TO BE ALONE! I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO ARGUE UNTIL I JUST GET WORN DOWN! 
 
 He is incredibly pushy, if he doesn't get his way he acts butthurt all day. 
 
 He bitches about my roommates more than I do! I know that they're loud and somewhat passive agressive and of course they get on my nerves sometimes but I can't handle all the negativity from him about it! He comes in my room and is just like ""What the fuck, when I walked in your house your roommate Woman1 gave me the dirtiest look."" ""Oh my god, I went to the kitchen to get water and Woman2 walked out of the room. What a bitch!"" He's like, personally upset with my roommates because they asked me to tell him not to be here as often and everything they do he perceives as an insult to him. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST DONE BEING IN THE KITCHEN AND SO THEY LEAVE OMGWTF. 
 
 He also gets upset with me when I don't like stand up to my roommates. I have no reason to do so! Seriously, one of my roommates used all my hair spray and didn't tell me. When I asked about it they realized what happened and gave me a new bottle. He was upset that I didn't say anything. Who gives a shit?!?!?! She replaced the hairspray immediately! 
 
 I have a male roommate. I will admit that he is a little weird sometimes and I feel like he is sort of flirting with me, but I have no interest and never respond. My boyfriend is still incredibly jealous of my male roommate. I cannot handle it. When he is not busy talking shit about my two female roommates he's talking shit about my male roommate ""Male roommate is so fucking creepy!"" ""Make sure you lock your door at night because I'm worried about what will happen!"" ""Even if you lock your door it's pretty easy to pick those locks!"" I think he uses that argument as a way to kind of freak me out and convince me that I should just let him stay over so that he can ""protect"" me. 
 
 He doesn't give a shit about himself. He has gained massve amounts of weight this year because he just doesn't give a fuck. I sometimes have to REMIND HIM TO SHOWER. He's a fucking adult. He should know when to shower. 
 
 He eats like, all of my groceries and then I depend on him for food when he buys groceries and it's this big tangled mess. 
 
 He's incredibly jealous of my female friends. Whenever I leave to go spend time with him he pouts and whines and it's SO ANNOYING. 
 
 I am his only friend. He makes no effort to have other friends. I tell him that being someone's everything is too much. Then he reminds me that last year, when I was suffering from an extreme depressive episode (I'm Bipolar II), and when I had no friends (because he drove them away by being really intrusive and kind of a dick), it was hard for him to be my everything too. That's not chillbrochad! Sorry for having a MENTAL ILLNESS. 
 
 When he gets drunk, he gets really fucking drunk. It's quite scary. 
 
 His parents are in serious denial. They KNOW he has a lot of problems and literally pawn them off on me. Like, they really expected me to allow him to just stay at my house forever because they just couldn't really face reality. They know he has like, substance abuse problems (he will openly admit that he is an addict) but they still give him limitless cash (which he spends on nothing but weed.) 
 
 
 So basically- he is a lazy, douchey, controlling, jealous guy and I am sooooo done with his shit. Here's the kicker though. I tried to break up with him on thursday evening and he WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT! He showed up at my house in the morning with flowers and coffee and 1000 apologies and he kept talking about like ""throwing away a beautiful, year-long relationship."" There was so much guilt trippage that I felt like I had no choice but to take him back. Now he keeps buying me things and asking if ""we're okay,"" and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! His birthday is this weekend, I feel like it's cruel to break up with him AGAIN on his birthday weekend. My mom suggested I wait and break up with him right before thanksgiving break so that he can't come bother me (we live on opposite sides of the state) but that's not until mid-November and every day that I have to put up with this shit I feel more and more drained, I'm not happy and I really don't love him anymore. I'm sorry that this is so long. I have no one else to talk to. I feel like I can't even tell my mom most of this because she would be so upset with him that I truly believe she would fly across the state and confront him (my mom is the greatest, seriously.) and it would also make me feel stupid for staying with him for so long. Most of my friends really just don't like him and then the few that do like him always just say that we're so perfect that we should never ever break up. I'm not worried about being alone, I'm just scared about hurting him or what the aftermath will be. SRS, WAT DO?!?!?!!?!",7104,"Need help with douchey terrible boyfriend and I have nobody else to talk to. 
 Edit: I accidentally commented on everything with my real account and had to delete all my comments! Thank you for your words of encouragement. I broke up with him for real about an hour ago.

"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. So I come from a family of big time Christians. Today marked the day of my step sisters baptism. My mother knows I'm an atheist, but she really wanted me to come and I agreed thinking is just watch her get water thrown in her face and I can leave. The pastor called our family, asking that we all went up to the front of the whole church. We all stood up there and he said some stuff then did something I wasn't ready for: started asking us individually that we accept Jesus as our lord and savior and will raise her a Christian. As usually my family members said they will. He got to me and asked me, ""will you accept Jesus as your lord and savior and raise your sister in the Christian way."" I stood silent for a bit, looked at the crowd and said, ""no, sorry, I won't."" Everyone stared at me in disbelief and there was a good 20 seconds of awkward silence before he finally just moved on. I spent the next 30 min with people looking at me and whispering to each other. I've never been so proud of myself though r/atheism, its not often I stand up for myself like that. I know this is gonna be downvoted by the hive but here it goes Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road. This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel. Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket."" But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me. He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck. No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had. So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow... But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English: ""Today you.... tomorrow me."" Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal. In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through: ""Today you.... tomorrow me.""",7453,"long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air. In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playground where I spent most of my days chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys, they were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air."" I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said ""fresh"" and had a dice in the mirror.

"My wife and I used to have a pretty normal relationship. I'm a sort of chunky bearded hairy middle aged man with a good income. She has a job bar tending . She is hot with large breasts, and it seemed the more she showed the more $ she made, so fine with me. Our sex life I thought was fine, she was always a little more horny than me but I tried to keep up. 
 Then things started to change, she really started liking our sexy times. She was getting later and later shifts at the bar and would wake me up because she needed me to eat her out. She liked it dark and always kept her top on, disappointing but a good husband pleases. The first few months she would hop on my unit when she got done and it was very satisfying and peculiar. She always had to be on top and it seemed to make me last longer so I went with it. After a few months went by she started giving me handjobs instead of her pussy, saying this way we both would get same amount of sex. She somewhere had learned to tug very well and it was satisfying. 
 One weekend for my birthday she wanted to surprise me with my present. So she got me naked and leaned me over the table. She blindfolded me and started her normal fingering of my ass. Then she started mysteriously giggling and I felt something way bigger go up my hole. She told me not to turn around as she plunged deeper and deeper into my ass, her naked tits bouncing off my back. She then spun me around and took off my blindfold revealing a strapon dildo she had bought online, in a f***eful voice telling me she was taking my ass and there wasn't anything I could do about it. She fucked me missionary like I was the girl. She told me if I wanted to cum I had to do it manually so I jacked off until I exploded. She cleaned me up and hugged and kissed me, saying how only a man who was confident in himself could do that, and what a sweetheart I was. She also hinted that she had some more ideas, pegging was just the start... 
 A few weekends later package came in the mail. She gleefully opened it up and it was a cb-6000 cock cage chastity device. I asked what was it for and she said she wanted to help our marriage, that this would make my orgasms better due to the loss of sensitivity caused by masturbation, and I would pay more attention to her sexual needs, and it would help with my premature ejaculation. It had been kind of an embarrassing week sexually that week for me so I really didn't have much choice. First step was to completely empty the sperm out of my balls. I figured she would fuck my brains out, but no she said there was a process. Ok no details but it was not in any way remotely enjoyable. Satisfied that I was dried out and super limp and tiny, she had me lay on my back, lubed the device and after about 5 adjustments locked me in the damn thing. Now she wasn't even being nice about anything, saying that cocks are gross and all should be locked up, and how my tiny little boo boo finally looked sexy to her as long as it was locked up and she was wearing the key. 
 A couple of weeks passed. The $ at my wife's work had grown dramatically. She was so proud and horny. I asked her when I could have my boo boo released and she told me a couple of weeks so I could build up a good orgasm. Her shifts kept getting later and later and she started coming home at all times of the night. She walked with kind of a limp, I wondered if she was ok. She mentioned Pilates so that when she finally let me out she would be sexier and more in shape. Couldn't see how she could get more sexy, she was glowing all the time. Her birthday came up so I had bought her a car, hoping that would convince her I was ready to be released. She thanked me, telling me what a wonderful husband I was and that she had a surprise for me. She said her biggest wish was to be totally sexually satisfied! I steadfastly agreed.O boy, good bye hell cage I thought. I had cooked her a romantic dinner w wine. She came to table just beautiful, in very slutty lingerie, god my caged cock hurt. But I noticed that she wasn't wearing the key to my cock cage. We had a wonderful dinner and went to the living room. She had me get naked except for the cock cage. We were on couch but she started giggling and kept me at an arms distance. I didn't get it, those globes were hanging in front of me but she wouldn't let me touch them. 
 Then  someone knocked at the door , I'm like what the hell, I wasn't expecting anyone and was naked. She got up and answered the door. It was Jamal, her large black Pilates instructor. She asked me if I was serious about her total sexual satisfaction. I said of course I was but it thought it meant us and that it would be us having sex together. She said ours was pretty good but recently she was fantasizing about Jamal and she wanted a change of pace. I guess. It is her birthday so agreed. She stripped him and then he took over. He called her his bitch, grabbed her neck and stuffed his cock in her mouth. 
 I felt sorry for her until I noticed the huge 10inch bbc went down her throat like nothing. Geez before my chastity, she choked on my 4"". He threw her around like he owned her, making her lick his arm pit then his big hairy balls. He threw her down on the floor spread her legs and rammed the shit out of her. He kept yelling at her to take it as she was his fucking bitch. Surprisingly she kept yelling yes master. Man this was some fantasy. She wanted me to participate in her happiness so she had me lay of the floor and she went into the 69 position. She gave me a pillow so my head was elevated. I was eating her as she played with my cock's plastic prison.She had me eating her out then he came up behind her to doggy her. She asked me to be a dear and put his huge rod in awaiting cunt. I shockingly and reluctantly complied putting that huge meat in her. She then required me to keep eating her, even though half the time I was licking the bottom of his rod and his huge balls bounced off of my forehead and nose. In the end he shot this gigantic load inside of her puss. Then he asked  clean off the huge head of his dick. She suddenly grabbed my balls and said aggressively to do it, so I actually polished his knob. She started shrieking OMG!!! I have no protection ! Honey, eat this cum out of my pussy before I have a black baby. God no! I gotta save the day, so I put my head down there and ate every drop of bbc cum he had dropped into her. Tasted kind of familiar, and she really enjoyed the oral, complimenting it was my best ever and that only a devoted husband would make her fantasy come true. I had blue balls and every part of my wife's body got abused by a black man but I was the hero. 
 The next weekend she had promised to release me if was willing to play a game. Man I was horny and my cock was sore in that cage so I agreed I made her dinner and this time she had the key! O boy! We were back on the couch again, and another black guy Dwan came by. She wanted to play strip poker. By this time I would do ANYTHING to get out of that goddamn cage. Amazingly even though she used to be poker dealer in Las Vegas she kept losing . Stark naked she told Dwan that she lost he could fuck her. She lost , I objected but they ignored me. She lost and he grabbed and kissed her and took her to the couch again. He pulled on her tits and had her hop on him. This is bullshit.  Fantasy is one thing, this is cheating . She is bouncing on him as I shudder in disbelief. She complains she needs a drink and has me come over there. I get there and she wants me to keep him hard while she mixes drinks. She mentions that it she finds cooperative husbands are sexy, is a fantasy of hers, and this will make us closer. So as I get closer, I'm kind of sk**dish. She gives me soft sexy eyes and says "" please? "" . So I opened my mouth and reluctantly complied. 
 As my mouth and tongue started working up and down his mushroom head and pulsating shaft with huge blue veins she began abusing me   "" OH MY GOD I CANT BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY DID IT! I always thought you were a faggot, now you are proving it ! I need a REAL MAN not a cocksucking fagot like you!""   I tried to explain to her that this actually disgusts me, and that I only did it to please her. Either she didn't hear me or didn't care as she kept pushing my head up and down on his mammoth meathood. Satisfied that I was performing correctly she mixed the drinks. When she came back she pulled me away. He was super hard and fucked her brains out, she made me first message then lick his huge balls and ass. He dumped in her and she made me eat it all up again. 
 Then my low moment came . She explained to me while I had my dick locked in a chastity device that I should of recognized the smell and taste of her cunt. She had been having black guys fuck her brains out for the past year and that I was orally douching their cum out of her puss. While she hid her tits and cunt from me that she let every black guy in the 5 state area fuck her brains out. Every second I was faithful and locked up she screwed another nigger. 
I started crying and said I was going away. Then she softly laid me on my back. She took the key around her neck and unlocked my pained penis. She then proclaimed how much she loved me and that she would make it right. As the device came off she sucked my throbbing cock like it had never before. She was just an expert. She could anticipate every response it and both my body and mind had. Pure ecstasy, she must have gained a great deal of cocksucking skill while she was cheating on me. I shot my biggest and best load in yrs, goddamn my body shivered and shaked .  She cuddled next to me and told me how only a real man would please her so . The next morning when she knew I was dry, she lubed up the cage and locked me back up. She told me that if I played my card right that in six months I may get another bj.",9883,I am devastated.,16,0.8269667029380798,0.0007102630916051,0.0311983935534954,0.0001195177392219,0.8124146461486816,0.0001851424021879,0.0073134945705533,0.0001159746170742,0.2467123866081237,0.0001773897529346,0.0217402540147304,0.0001440115011064,"""She stripped him and then he took over.

"So, late Monday night, I had a call from an ex plate. Now, I haven't seen this plate for a good six or seven weeks. The prime reason being was that she was getting far too needy and really wanted the LTR upgrade. 
 Despite her good looks and the fact that she takes care of herself, she's way too entitled. She's too good to cook, her Mother still cleans her flat for her weekly and her army of beta orbiters are just way too numerous and involved. They bore me. 
 She had been wanting to meet with me for over two weeks asking me to various functions and shit. But as I've just changed jobs, I really have not had the time. Plus she's too much effort. I have other lower-investment plates. 
 Anyway. During Monday's phone call, she tells me that she was late on her period, took a pregnancy test and it's positive. She claims it's mine. 
 Now, I'll admit a shiver went down my spine. Sort of like an ""Oh fucking fuck"" kind of moment. But I'm a rational man and I'm not about to do this on the phone. I tell her to meet me and we'll discuss it. 
 I met her yesterday. She thought we were going for a nice coffee to discuss our bright future. But I had other plans, a series of quick fire questions in the car park and wouldn't you know it, her bullshit showed cracks. Not immediately, this specimen is definitely one of the smarter hamsters, But like most women, she sucks hard at math. But dear oh dear, the lengths these women go to. 
 ""When did you find out about this?"" I ask, all concerned. ""Oh, a few days ago..."" 
 ""How long are you late by?"" Four weeks. Hmmm, a very succinct and well thought out answer, puts it right in the ballpark, huh. 
 ""So you did a pregnancy test two days ago?"" Yep it was positive. 
 ""That's strange. You mean you weren't freaking the fuck out when you were a week or two late?"" Oh no, I was definitely. But I didn't know then. 
 ""Did you do a test then?"" Oh, no. Does it matter? It's positive. 
 ""Have you seen the doctor?"" Yes, he said I definitely am. 
 ""When did you see the doc?"" Now she gets evasive. She blurts out ""A couple of days ago, look are we going to discuss this or are you going to keep on grilling me?"" 
 Flag right there! I know after my Sister's kid that Doctors don't deal with pregnant women in the UK. They are normally led by the midwife. The response the receptionist would have given her would have been that if the pregnancy test was positive there is no need for a Doc's appointment and secondly to schedule a midwife appointment at 16 weeks. 
 She may be playing the victim card, but I'm playing the ""You're full of shit and we both know it"" card. 
 So far, I was trying to determine if she was pregnant. My initial hunch was that she is not. 
 We finally head in and we get a coffee. She's surprised when she has to pay for herself. Hey, you're going to try and play me, no way I'm going to pony up the dough for a grande latte with whatever else shotted in there. 
 We carry on talking. I just said, ""It must have been after XYZ Event in that case."" I wanted her to think she had won. ""Yep, must have been. But then condoms fail 5% of the time or something"". Five per cent? Really? That is fascinating. Who'da thunk we'd be the unlucky 5%. 
 Now I'm a careful chap. I learned condom use and disposal early in life and I've never so much as had an even slightly off experience with them. I know my brand and know my lube. 
 ""Who else knows, then?"" I ask. She evades the question again and says she wanted to see how I would react. 
 We get to the question of abortion. She says it's off the menu - convenient. She said it loud enough too for a few nearby people to hear. Crafty bitch. 
 I of course play the respectable moral man. I just say, ""Well, of course, if it's mine I'll happily raise it and support it."" A gleam goes across her eyes at such words. Yet the fact she paid for her own coffee must have been playing heavy. ""Do you earn enough to support all three of us?"" she asks. 
 ""Oh yes my dear. But, I do have to ask, do you earn enough to support yourself after your maternity leave?"" 
 A slightly confused look on her face, she asks ""Well, I can't go to work straight away, I'll need time off at the beginning and help with that... "" A lot of talking in other words. 
 ""Well, my lunch hour is up sadly. I'll call you later tonight!"". 
 I cut things off because she was getting louder and more hysterical. I wasn't going to win this one with logic. 
 OK, so now I'm worried. Am I going to get saddled with a kid that I really don't think is mine? Is she even pregnant. Annoyingly, at the extreme ends, the timelines mentioned are plausible. But I can't help but notice that all of this coincides with my recent new job and significant pay raise. A subject which I told nobody except for family who then congratted me over social media. Fucking idiots, I told them not to! I don't like being that public. 
 But anyway. This problem at hand. 
 Hmmmm.... 
 This girl is needy. 
 She posts a lot of instagram and facebook pictures. 
 Bingo. 
 Load up Facebook app on phone, ""How about Chad as a name if it's a boy?"" I write on her wall. (Thanks TRP!) 
 Five minutes later, her Sister has chimed in with ""What the hell? XXX, do you have some news? Call me now!"" 
 I think I'll just let this one play out a little. May as well spread the word, eh? 
 Fifteen minutes in, things are going sweet. She's had to admit it with an ""Umm, kind of..."" Suddenly congratulatory messages from far and wide, I bet from friends and relations she hasn't seen in decades! Aww, I spy a baby shower! How lovely I think. 
 Oh, wait what? A new message? 
 ""I wanted to wait"" she says, ""until we'd decided what to do!"" 
 ""I thought you were against abortion?"" I ask. 
 A few minutes of XXX is typing, then disappearing. She's obviously having to work overdrive to make this response awesome as hell. 
 ""I am. We will talk later!"" 
 I really wanted to say, ""I just wondered what the weight of public exposure would do for your little ruse..."" I've definitely rattled her cage a little. Let's see what falls out. 
 I got home about 6pm tonight. It's been a long day. But what's this? The facebook post has disappeared? Deleted you say? All comments erased, you say? Fascinating. Oh but there's more... her facebook account is GONE? But.... all her pictures of herself in places that she's been once with her holding a fruity drink... Just all gone? 
 7pm rolls around. I sent her a couple of texts inviting her to talk. I get a single solitary text back. ""It's not fucking yours, OK?"" 
 I virtual high five the God who invented facebook attention whores. 
 I respond, ""What are you talking about? Who's is it?"" 
 ""<guy's name>"" 
 I ponder... who the hell is <guy's name> again... OOOOH Shit... now I know... And really, I know her story before I even asked. 
 Now, my little red piller. If you've read this far, you know that I'm having fun now. But, the rest of this isn't quite so fun. Not every story here is about sticking it to a stupid woman trying it on. I was enjoying myself up until now, but there's a time things get a little, shall we say, empathetic. Anyway here goes. 
 I go bluepill here. I call her instead of texting back. 
 ""What the fuck?"" I think were my first words out. I was expecting the uneasy silence before she started talking. When she did, she comes across as someone who's had the shit verbally kicked out of her over a prolonged period. She broke up on the phone telling me that after I split with her, one of her beta orbiters... no let me be clear, her PRIMARY fucking beta orbiter and her had a few glasses of wine too many after a meal he cooked for her as a cheer-up effort and, well... one thing led to another, and that one thing was unprotected fucking. 
 The crying down the phone was insurmountable. I have never heard a creature that wretched sounding in my life. I hate to say it, even though hours earlier I could have fired her out of a cannon into the sun for trying to fuck me over, I knew exactly what the problem was with this whole picture. Largely in thanks to TRP. But really, I felt what's the point in finishing the demolition. It's clear I'm off the hook, call it a panic attack, a standard female reaction to a bad situation. 
 ""Now <girl>"", I start saying, ""you need to think long hard and carefully here. <Guy> can barely wipe his arse, he gets walked all over by his work and so-called friends and he is one slimey little shit. You really need to think if this guy is going to be worth his salt as a father to your kid."" 
 More bawling. And the red pill truths just spill out with her guts like she's just been drawn and quartered. 
 ""He's such a pussy. He played the nice guy to me all these years. All he ever really wanted was to fuck me and he just kept around me even when I said I just wanted to be friends and buying me things and all this shit. And then when you split up with me, he just got me drunk knowing I was too fucked up to think straight. I'm so stupid and yada yada"" You get the drift. 
 The bottom line, he's a pussy. She knows it. She keeps avoiding his calls. More to the point, she keeps avoiding this sad little beta's Mother's calls! That's right, it's his Mother who's trying to get her on the phone and is now in charge of ""the situation"". 
 I decided I had to call her on it. ""Why did you try to make me think I was the Father?"" Apparently it was obvious. Next to beta, I was alpha. There were more words in there, like how I'm actually in control of shit, I know where my life is headed and I called her on her bullshit all the time. Then when I finally got sick of her shit and left her alone, she missed me like crazy and even ""saw the error of her ways"". But when I blew her off, she went into meltdown. And that's when Primary Beta took his chance. A bit of a slimy thing to do in my book. But Betas gonna beta! She was all broken up, he cooked her a meal and got some wine, talker her into taking her pants off. Whaddya gonna do. Grim, now I think about it, but hey. 
 She had to admit all these things to her Sister who was mad that nobody knew about the pregnancy in the first place. Her Sister laid down a few harsh words too about her lying to me (good on ya sister!) and even reckoned that Beta will never be Father material either. 
 I finished up with her and said, ""Good luck and I'd seriously reconsider keeping it before his fucking Mother gets involved. You really want her in your life forever more?"" 
 She responded saying that having either Beta or his Mother in the picture everywhere just wasn't an option; she would emigrate if she had to. 
 I get where she's coming from. Beta is 34, has a relatively decent paying job. But he's a thorough Mummy's boy. I wouldn't be surprised if this guy only just lost his virginity in this very scenario. He had a lot to say about me too when he first met me. Anytime I'd call her on her shit, he'd immediately defend her. He was pussy beta, through and through. Anytime me and this ex-plate were done fucking, we would actually sometimes laugh about him, about how he's a lap dog and tales of times where he showed up and played taxi sometimes for hundreds of miles. LOL sad shit. 
 Yep, I guess I'm not quite TRP. I should laugh at her and tell her she's a stupid slut. I should be on Beta's side with Father's rights and all this shit. But really, I would bet my arse that he did play the nice guy and seized his moment of vulnerability. From the texts and things I got after I stopped seeing her, she was definitely missing me hard. 
 Lessons here, sirs and for the ladies watching. 
 
 First, Nice Guys really ARE the ones to look out for. Conniving little shits I think is more accurate. Really, an alpha is a far safer bet. 
 Secondly, given the option between a beta and alpha, a girl will make a play for the alpha every time. You know it, I know it. Wait for it to happen, it'll be far more real. 
 Third, there is such a thing as being so beta a girl still won't want you anywhere near your own offspring. Even if you can offer financial support. 
 Fourth, men know your condoms. I play around just like you and I am never too inebriated to make sure the damned thing is on correctly, I am never too desperate to use hers and I sure as shit am not trusting any girl with a birth control pill until she proves she's trustworthy! And even then, there will be spot checks. 
 Fifth, alpha widows are fucking nuts. They will do dangerous things when pushed. I wouldn't be surprised if this alpha widow is close to throwing herself off a balcony right now.

"First off let me start by saying this was the second dumbest thing I have ever done with drugs. I have always considered myself a pretty responsible user of drugs, and have generally stayed away from anything other than weed and psychedelics (yeah fuck you bot I did it) This was because I had done my research on drugs, and things like opiates and amphetamine seemed like things I would not enjoy. Surely not benzos. But, after a trip to the ER for an infected insect bite on my ass, I got myself a good amount of morphine. At this point in time I had taken a stupid amount of benadryl once around 3 years prior (im not exact on dates, or any of this really, still pretty fucked up.) that really fucked with my head, and still continues to. I had also taken LSD maybe 5 or 6 times by then. I actually took a dose one of the days after I got out of the hospital, and it worked well in place of the morphine for pain relief, when I took the morphine at 2am it knocked me right out. 
 Sorry I got distracted, I am writing this while it is still fresh in my head, so I'm still pretty fucked on the speed and the coke and the weed and I'm tripping pretty hard. Just got home, opened up my computer, and my camera app was open (fucking windows 8) It always shows the last thing that was displayed on the screen and I very briefly saw what looked to be me blacked out on ativan with blood running down my face. I didn't remember this happening, and unfortunately I am not staying in the same house I was last night, so I cant go look for bloody rags. There is also no way I can have any idea if I interacted with anyone in that state. I hope to god I didn't. 
 Anyways this was just stupid as fuck and I thought I would share. The most intense high I have ever felt, but not worth the blacking out ant the fact that I took fucking every drug i could get my hands on. So the day started, I woke up around 1-130pm took my daily 25mg xr Adderall that I take on weekdays but stash on weekends because I'm really sketched out about pills and don't want to build as much of a tolerance. Lol if thats not how it works let me know. 
 So I took my adderall, and around 2pm my friend Archer hits me up to split like 5ish grams of some really good shrooms with him. I am really excited, because he's my trip buddy. And it has been too long since we just chilled with eachother and tripped. The past few times I had done acid There had been an overwhelming amount of people and I couldn't handle socialization and so got all lost in my head. I prefer trips in groups of 4 or less. 5 is cool too. We each eat half in the time between 230 and 3, and then we chill for around 2 hours and smoke a bong or 3. My friends mom hit him up on short notice to watch his little brother for an hour since she had to go to work and his babysitter bailed. We left my place and went over there, his mom was suspicious but had no solid evidence and is not going to just randomly accuse her 19 year old son of tripping balls because he was acting silly. She ordered us pizza and left. So far so good. Bad stomach cramps but I never notice those until I'm coming down. I always just confuse them for part of the body high. But yeah, everything is good, friends mom gets home, we are going to go to Krieger's house soon, but he wants to chill alone for a bit so archer goes to his house to nap and drops me off at home. It's when I am alone that things get bad. This is not where all the pill shit happens. Thats like 3 or 4 hours later. 
 I get dropped off at 7ish, Go up to my room still tripping balls. Just cant figure out what to do with myself. Sometimes I just get really really sad, and I don't know why because I couldn't ask for a better life, but everyonce in a while I will get really sad while I am tripping. It has happened 3 times including this, out of 15+ trips, and it usually has only happened for like 2 hours in times when I have been alone. I get really sad, Just curl up on my bed, try to sleep, cry for a while. I couldn't really figure out why I was sad. No matter how hard I thought about it, and have been thinking about it, I haven't been able to figure out. I just sat on my bed, thinking. For about half an hour I tore my room apart looking for any trace of a cigarette. I had my ecig but it really just wasnt cutting it. I smoke like a sixth of a camel wide and a clove that the filter fell off of. I was a wreck. I don't know what happened, but something finally clicked, and I decided I needed to try anti depressants again. 
 I had a terrible experience with prozac in 5th grade. Fucked up they would perscribe it to me that young after like one psychologist visit but yeah, 5th through 9th grade I took prozac, i dont know how much  but the pills were caps and they were half blue and half orange. I decided I needed to talk to my doctor about this, because I know other people dont feel like this all the time, and I've just been so depressed I cant even do anything. before today, it had been a week since I had even showered. I was a wreck, and I couldn't do anything about it, but I decided it was time to get help, and I was quite happy with that. 
 My friend Archer hit me back up since I had let him know how I was feeling and asked if I could come back over since Kreiger had just a stupid amount of people at his house and fuck that. I came over, we played that fucking middle earth game and it was really colorful. Tried to watch something maybe, could have tried eating. It was rough, the adderall and shrooms fucked my stomach and I couldnt eat for over 24 hours. still hurts. 
 Anyways, Archer gets tired and drives me home to my place. At the moment I am jobless, and living back and forth between split parents trying to finish my highschool online classes so I can graduate and get out of this goddamn rut. Archer drops me off, and I bum a cigarette from him. I'll bet it was the best damn cigarette I have ever smoked. I had 4mg of Ativan sitting around. I have only ever done klonopin once 2mgs and I felt nothing except a little less anxious. This is where I fuck up really bad. I had researched it very lightly beforehand, this was not planned, I just remembered I had it and wanted sleep so badly. I knew it was often prescribed to insomniacs, and since I often have an unreasonably high tolerance to drugs I have never taken (MDMA, Morphine, Codeine, Adderall,) I figured I would start a bit high than the recommended 3mg recreational dose. I had also taken 60 mg codeine in t3 form when Archer picked me up. Sorry just remembered that. So I took the 4mg ativan, and sat on my computer browsing reddit. My plan was to stop being on my computer once I noticed the drowsyness, I'd smoke the last cig, which is disgusting right before sleep but idgaf I am a disgusting man. 
 So I never got drowsy. Because I never got drowsy, and was still tripping, and on opiates, and adderall, my judgement was already muddled. I just kind of figured I didn't feel anything, I was definitely way too fucked up, but of course I didn't realize it. I didn't even realize I had blacked out at first, but then I noticed all my fucking codeine were gone. I thought back on it and there was a pretty distinct point in time that things just got really blurry, and then whoosh they unblurred. We will get to how that happens in a second. 
 Through what i assumed to be witty and amusing texts to my friend Pam, as well as the fragments of memories I managed to retain (I black out alot, usually drink too much, and when im matching a 200lbs man shot for shot things get embarassing. Nothing was as bad as the benadryl though. But yeah ive gotten good at recalling snippits from blackouts.) I managed to figure out exactly how much I took. Boy, is this alot. I'm honestly really embaressed, and this isnt me. When you take benzos at high doses, it seems to just bring out the fucking drunk spoiled 16 year old white girl in everyone. You get just all self entitled, and dont really think you are fucked up when you are the most fucked up person in whatever place you are currently in. It's a bummer. I guess Ativan specifically people say hide your drugs before you take it. Boy were they fucking right. I really fucked up here 
 I am 125-28 depending on the day and if i have had one of those gross greasy 3lb stoner shits yet today. I'm a 6'1 18 year old male. This is just so you know how hard it hit me. I thought I could handle my shit, but any shred of that was gone as soon as that picture of my face with blood just pouring out of my nose popped up on my computer. So I started with a 25 xr and a 20 xr I had leftover from my old perscription. Those I took orally, since I was plannin on an all nighter at this point. I then took 4, maybe 5 tylenol 3s from my scrip with 9 remaining. this was given to me due to a followup surgery for the butt infection thing its gross im sorry i mentioned it. so details are quite hazy, I have pictures i sent to a friend of mine while blacked out. I couldnt find any of the tylenol 3s when i woke up so i very likely took all 9 eventually. So i did the 25mg line of the xrs, crushed into a fine powder. Hit me pretty decently on top of the now 70mg i had taken orally. I am pretty sure around here I took more codeine, railed another 25, I was full blackout, was brownout up till around when I think I started taking the codeine, slightly conscious, I fixed that right up with that codeine though. Did all the texting of pam, I had a very large line ready, between 50 and 70 mg. I'm lucky that was the only drug I had left because it snapped me out of that horrible blackout fucked up shit. Anything else and I probably would have died, I cant imagine all those drugs mixing around is all that great for you. 
 This deserves a whole paragraph, because that line, was the climax of the most intense feelings i have ever gotten from drugs. This insanity, being trapped in a haze, barely awake unable to control your own body tripping absolute balls. I was still having ridiculous visuals at this point, and could really only make out the simplest of patterns. my brain couldn't do shit. I didnt even use a roll to snort the adderall, there was a ridiculous amount. When I snorted it I just felt the most intense rush of fire electricity stuff go through my body, and the visuals were at this point impossible to describe. It was the most intense, powerful, feeling, like my body had been deprived of blood, and suddenly it all rushed back in. but my blood was colorful fire laser stuff, and i could see it. 
 I snapped back to reality after an hour or two of just spacing out staring around in awe. Shit was crazy. It was 7:00 and I was still tripping pretty hard. Felt really good. Motivated. Lots of adderall xD. Super OCD deep cleaned my disgusting pit of a room, raked my yard for my mom. Still tripping. I went with Archer to scoop some bud. He was really glad I was okay. Telling him about it kinda made me realize how bad that could have been. We got high af and though about I have been a lot more open to the possibility of experimenting with addictive drugs but I overstepped my limits and was lucky to come out unharmed. (sorry liver) I'm taking a break from the opiates, because I did not notice how fond of those I was becoming. Benzos, never again. I understand they help people as perscribed sometimes, but I would get crazy addicted to that, plus, I WAS REALLY FUCKING PISSED AT MYSELF FOR EATING ALL MY FUCKING DRUGS. Then later that night I did a bump of coke. It was cool, kinda buried in the muddle of all the other stuff. its been about 36 hours since I took the boomers, I made it through today with little bumps of adderall, and the coke at the end that a friend of mine Lana gave to me cause hes a chill as motherfucker. Bout to smoke a goodnight bowl and half a cig I found up in my hat and sleep. Still tripping..... still tripping.... Archer was fine after he went to sleep, thinks its just cause i'm sleep deprived. will update when not tripping. Sorry about all the mistakes and the craziness of the writing. Sleep deprivation, shrooms, coke, speed, weed, and codeine......... will update and edit later when im sleeped and the words arent moving and my hands aren't shaking. Heart rate seems fine, think I'm good to sleep. Really hope shit doesn't look like this when I wake up. I've had some bad HPPD symptoms for a while, but its been 36 hours since i took them and I feel like I am peaking on a good 200ug tab of acid. got that shroomy breathing still. colors are really weird, i keep hearing really faint nonexistant music in my fan, and im getting these lines of light and color darting around in my peripheral vision. patterns are not pronounced, but If i look at anything with any kind of shapes in it for longer than a few seconds it will start breaking down getting more and more fractally until it stops at a point. sorry again for how badly this is written, I'm really fucked up and just thankful im alive, and this seemed interesting, so i wanted to record it while it was still fresh. no idea how much ill remember when i wake up tomorrow.",13117,"I did my perscribed adderall. Than some scary good shrooms. smoked a lot of bong loads because duh. took 60 mg codeine because i was alone and trip was uncomfortable chilled with friend, went home, took 4mg ativan with no benzo tolerance trying to get sleep, made me black out and I went on a pill binge, did 9 Tylenol 3s plus the 2 earlier and from what i can tell, 190mg adderall. 70mg xr orally and 2 25mg lines followed by a large, 70+ line. switched back and forth between taking speed and opiates until I snapped myself out of the benzo craze with that big line of adderall i told you about earlier. stayed awake all night, felt fine, smoked all day along with little bumps of speed to keep me awake so I didnt fuck my sleep cycle worse. did a line of coke around 11 tonight. its 3 am now still tripping more than i should be after 36 hours. Still tripping fairly hard. Gonna try and sleep it out. smoking a bowl and a cigarette and then the sleeps 
 HEY I AM STUPID AS FUCK. OBVIOUSLY DONT GO DOING THESE THINGS I JUST TALKED ABOUT. THATS SOME SKETCHY SHIT. I FIND THIS WHOLE THING WAY MORE AMUSING THAN I SHOULD, I AM PROBABLY CRAZY. I dont really know what else to say in a warning, its just kind of obvious you shouldn't do this. I had alot of fun doing it though. would not do again, but since im not dead its chill, and now i have this silly story .so i guess it all works out. probably should have put this at the top but i already started my cigarette so this post is over. goodnigh
Edit- took forever to fall asleep. Only got two or three hours tops. Holy shit was I fucked. Still not all the way normal yet.
